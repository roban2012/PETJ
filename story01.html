Well, how DO you stack up?<br><br>

Chances are that whatever athletic level you have achieved, there are some serious gaps in your OVERALL strength program. Gaps that stop you short of being able to claim status as a TRUE man.<br><br>

The good news is that-in Convict Conditioning-Paul Wade has laid out a brilliant 6-set system of 10 progressions which allows you to master these elite levels. And you could be starting at almost any age and in almost in any condition!<br><br>

Paul Wade has given you the keys-ALL the keys you'll ever need- that will open door after door after door for you in quest for REAL physical accomplishment. Yes, it will be the hardest work you'll ever have to do. And yes, 97% of those who pick up Convict Conditioning, frankly, won't have the guts and the fortitude to make it. But if you make it even half-way through Paul's Progressions, you'll be stronger than almost anyone you encounter.<br><br>

If you're a 3-percenter, in particular, then this book is for you. Have at it!<br><br>

No Weights, No Limits: An Interview With Paul Wade<br><br>


by Nick Collias <br><br>
Jun 10, 2013 <br><br>











 My, what a big program you have. Author Paul Wade isn't impressed. You're spending countless gym hours to look like the Spartans from 300, but the real warriors did it with just what the gods gave them!  <br><br>

 
Paul Wade went into the California prison system in 1979 to serve a long sentence among the nation's most hardened criminals. He emerged more than two decades later with a sentence for the rest of us, in the form of his acclaimed 2009 book Convict Conditioning: How to Bust Free of All Weakness Using the Lost Secrets of Supreme Survival. His decree: Do six moves: Push-ups, pull-ups, squats, handstands, a forward abdominal bend, and a backward spinal bridge. That's it. And if you do them with "the right knowledge and a big bucketful of determination," that's enough. <br><br>

Scrolling through the strength programs outlined on fitness websites―including this one―and you'll probably wonder exactly how that could be enough. Push-ups and pull-ups in the modern gym are usually either appetizers or dessert―a pre-exhaust warm-up, or in immense quantities to "rep out" after a hard workout. Wade's system made them the main course by focusing on steps rather than reps. <br><br>

In Convict Conditioning, each of the "big six" is broken down into 10 progressive stages, each culminating in a benchmark rep goal. If knocking out 40 push-ups is a breeze, good for you; you're still only at step five. You've earned the right to do arrowhead push-ups instead. The ultimate goals in this model are "master steps" like the pistol squat and one-armed pull-ups, each one earned by long periods of regular practice. In the 2011 follow-up Convict Conditioning 2, Wade integrated more complicated goal moves like the clutch flag, the neck bridge, and fingertip push-ups. <br><br>

In and around the intensive technique explanation of these manuals, he crafts an intricate narrative of bodyweight training through history, weaving in the ancient Greeks, monks, prisoners, and legendary strongmen like Charles Atlas. "They might have demonstrated their power by unleashing it on external objects like nails and barrels," he writes of these men, "but in many cases they actually built that basic strength through control of the body." <br><br>

Last year, the reigning purist of bodyweight training released the Convict Conditioning DVD Series, filmed at none other than Alcatraz. Only five of the "Big Six" have been covered in this series thus far (no handstand push-ups yet), and the 10 steps are accompanied by 10 "commandments" for each movement, detailing technique onscreen and in illustrated manuals. 
	<br><br>

 
Most of us know the word "calisthenics," but for different people it means everything from tactical pull-ups to jazzercise and leg warmers. What does it mean to you, and what is "progressive" calisthenics?<br><br>
To me, calisthenics is mastery of body movement. Nothing else. In calisthenics, you move your body―not a barbell, a dumbbell, machine, infomercial gadget, or anything else. As such, calisthenics is not a side discipline of fitness. It must be the center, the core of all training. All of it. <br><br>

Yoga and flexibility training are just about moving the body in certain ways; that's calisthenics. Running, swimming, and all basic cardio are moving the body; that's calisthenics too. Balance training on the beam or upside-down in a handstand, that's calisthenics. Agility and explosive work, tumbling, jumps, flips and kicks―it's all calisthenics. The most primal form of strength training involves using the body's own weight to build strength through movement. That's calisthenics, also. <br><br>

Using progressive techniques, an expert can take any bodyweight exercise from a ridiculously easy rehab level all the way up to the limit of human power and ability, a "holy shit" level. Pull-ups are a good example. Most coaches only know about regular two-arm pull-ups, but what about easier versions like jackknife pull-ups, or leg-assisted pull-ups? And what about harder pull-ups? <br><br>

Just like barbell or dumbbell training, if you want to get stronger, you hit a target number of reps and then make things tougher. With barbell training this is easy; you just add more weight. With calisthenics it's more sophisticated, because you need to be taught the exercise progressions. I can teach you 30 or more distinct progressions leading you up to one-arm pull-ups. By the time you can pump out six one-arms, you will have the strength to snap the average bodybuilder's bones in an arm-wrestling match. You'll also have biceps like kegs of beer. This, to me, is true progressive calisthenics. But who teaches this kind of shit anymore? It's been mostly lost in the outside world. 
<br><br>
What sort of misconceptions do people have about bodyweight training?<br><br>

The biggest mistake people make about bodyweight-only training is the idea that it is good for basic conditioning, but cannot build high levels of muscle and strength. To people who think this way, I say: Yes it can. You just need to know how to use the exercises progressively. <br><br>

In reality, bodyweight training and serious muscle gain go hand-in-glove. You just have to take a look at an Olympic gymnast to see that. These guys only use bodyweight, but they often have physiques which would see them winning natural bodybuilding shows. And they don't even train to gain mass. Imagine what they would look like if they did! 
<br><br>
The same is true for strength. If anyone tells me that bodyweight-only work can't make them strong, I challenge them to get to the stage where they can bust out: <br><br>
--5 one-arm push-ups (prison-style, with the feet close)<br><br>
--5 one-arm pull-ups (no kipping)<br><br>
--10 handstand push-ups<br><br>
--20 pistol squats<br><br>
--20 strict hanging leg raises<br><br>
--10 stand-to-stand bridges<br><br>

	5个悬垂直举腿 Leg Raises（最好2×30个）<br><br>
	1个铁板桥 Bridges（最好2×30个）<br><br>
Then come back and tell me that they aren't Spiderman-strong. <br><br>
What can progressive calisthenics training offer that people may be surprised by?<br><br>

I think what surprises most athletes who try it is the effect bodyweight strength work has on the joints. There's no getting around this: Done right, bodyweight training strengthens your joints instead of wearing them down. Why? Because the body was meant to move itself. We literally evolved to push and pull ourselves around, and to squat and jump using bodyweight. <br><br>

This is why all bodybuilders should include a bodyweight base to keep the joints strong. I'm a big believer that you should master bodyweight before using weights. If you can't do a bodyweight squat correctly, how in Christ's name are you going to squat heavy and get it right? You need to build the bodyweight neural patterns, the tendons, and the deep tissues before bulking up and hoisting up the big iron. All the legendary old school bodybuilders and lifters performed bodyweight work along with the weights. This was true right up to the '60s. <br><br>
 
Today you have young guys piling mountains of iron on the leg press to perform teeny-tiny little reps, but they can't do a single full one-leg squat―and they wonder why their knees hurt all the time. Kids load up the bar for bench presses when they can't even do 20 deep push-ups. Bodybuilders blow out their backs all the time bending over to heave up weight on the barbell row, when they aren't even close to doing 10 strict pull-ups. It's no coincidence many bodybuilders are so racked with pain. It doesn't have to be this way. <br><br>

I get emails and letters all the time from young and old athletes who write to say they thought they would never train again because their knees, backs, shoulders or wrists were busted up. Six months of progressive calisthenics and these "hopeless cases" are amazed to be as lithe as tigers. They have cured their joint pain and arthritis, and are stronger and bigger than ever―with less body fat as a bonus. <br><br>

None of this is a dis to weight training, or any shit like that. Many of the [Progressive Calisthenics Certification] instructors either use weights themselves, or still train clients with weights at times. But progressive calisthenics is an incredibly valuable and totally underused tool, especially for bodybuilders. I even wrote a post for bodybuilders on the PCC blog inviting you guys and girls to join us. <br><br>

Bodyweight training is thousands of years old and ties into many traditions, from martial arts to yoga, gymnastics, and ancient Greek athletics. Where does progressive calisthenics meet or overlap with other traditions?<br><br>

That's a great point. Most folks forget that the adjustable barbell is only just over a century old. That's nothing! For the rest of human history―stretching right back to when we were swinging in trees―our species built its strength using bodyweight. <br><br>

Like you say, progressive bodyweight techniques can be found in martial arts and yoga systems dating back thousands of years. Herodotus tells us that the Spartan warriors at the Battle of Thermopylae performed strength calisthenics―this was 25 centuries ago. Bodyweight progressions can also be found in prison systems, modern gymnastics styles, and military conditioning methods. To me, progressive calisthenics isn't in competition with any of these fine traditions; it's a distillation of the best techniques and tactics from all of them, systematized into logical order and field-stripped so all you need to find is a bar to hang from. <br><br>

I'm way too old for any of the "mine is bigger than yours" bullshit when it comes to comparing bodyweight strength approaches. It's a waste of time. I respect all athletes and wannabe athletes, whatever their method or mindset. Many athletes from other systems―martial arts, yoga, gymnastics―have already signed up to be part of the PCC team. The skills and strategies athletes learn with us will be taken back to their own disciplines, and similarly our community will be richer from their input. It's an exciting time to get involved in bodyweight training. Maybe the best time ever. <br><br>
You've started a certification course for bodyweight instruction. Why is a certification for bodyweight necessary? My junior-high gym teacher seemed to think he had all the answers when it came to push-ups and pull-ups.<br><br>

A certification for bodyweight strength is not necessary. You don't need to buy a damn thing to benefit from calisthenics. As far as I'm concerned, as long as your doc is OK with it, you can practice and master bodyweight techniques and progressions by yourself in your basement, in your bedroom, or in the park. Hell, the majority of the great bodyweight athletes I've met did most of their learning alone in cells. <br><br>

Nobody is required to attend this cert. In fact, I hope folks reading this will want be part of the PCC community even if they never plan to attend. But if you want to get some focused expert coaching that can accelerate your personal learning curve dramatically, or maybe if you train others for a living and want the best "toolbox" at your disposal, then I'd rather athletes have the option of getting qualified with the super-trainers at Dragon Door [Publications]. If you spend three solid days of intensive training with Al Kavadlo, you are guaranteed a quantum leap in your knowledge and abilities. You will be revolutionized. <br><br>

Who is progressive calisthenics for? What type of people have reached out to you or utilized it so far?<br><br>

Oh Jesus. How do I answer that? Progressive calisthenics is for everyone. I've trained bodybuilders who were looking for a fresh burst of muscle growth and powerlifters interested in seeing what new strength tricks calisthenics could teach them. I get a mix of young and old. Most of the older athletes are using calisthenics to heal old dings and build strength without incurring new injuries. Many of the younger athletes who contact me now are interested in bodyweight because it's cool; the funky shit appeals to them. 
<br><br>
Unless you are a weight trainer, a heavy bench press just looks kinda boring, but bodyweight moves like muscle-ups, flags, L-holds, handstand push-ups, and one-arm pull-ups? They impress people. They are fun and challenging to learn. Young athletes are leaving the gyms in a mass exodus. They are training outdoors, in parks, doing bodyweight arts like parkour. 
 <br><br>
It doesn't matter what level you are currently at―Olympic athlete or couch potato―everyone can, and should, be doing bodyweight work. Age is not a factor, either. Children take to bodyweight exercises very easily. It's like play to them. Because there is no external load, young kids, even infants, can train with zero risk to their growth. Most bodybuilders think they are too old when they hit 40, but bodyweight athletes are still strong at 70, 80, and beyond. Unlike most other disciplines, bodyweight strength training becomes more important as you get older, not less. <br><br>

Elderly men and women don't need a huge bench press or deadlift; they need to be able to squat in and out of chairs. If they fall, they need the strength to press themselves back up again. This is all bodyweight training! <br><br>

In a recent blog post you wrote entitled The Tao of PCC, you discussed some of the differences between Convict Conditioning and what you're teaching in PCC. One is sustained static holds. How else are you refining the idea of progressive calisthenics?<br><br>

The most important difference between Convict Conditioning and PCC is that Convict Conditioning is just about building raw muscle and strength using bodyweight only. This was the kind of goal inmates all had, and the workouts in the book were built around this goal. PCC is not tied to any specific objectives. It's more like a toolbox you can dip in and out of; once you learn how the progressions work, you can tailor them to any goal you have in mind. This can be muscle-building, strength, skill, and balance in static holds, functionality, mobility, joint health―whatever. <br><br>

I liken PCC to a "bodyweight barbell." Once you know how to change the plates on a barbell, you can adjust it and use it for any training goal, from strength and power, to fitness, to building muscle, to endurance. You can do almost anything with a barbell. PCC teaches you how to make your own body a barbell―the ultimate barbell you take with you everywhere.<br><br>

28 Laws Of Lifting For Muscle	<br><br>

by Bill Geiger <br><br>
Mar 11, 2015 <br><br>











 If building muscle is in your gain plan, start here with these helpful tips!<br><br>  



Each year thousands of newcomers begin some sort of bodybuilding program, but a majority of them are unsuccessful. It's no wonder; far too many just show up at the gym and lift, which may―or, more likely, may not―be the best and fastest method to make gains.<br><br>

Those who succeed tend to follow a well-formulated plan. In fact, we guarantee that if you incorporate our best mass-building training tips below―which we put together with the help of IFBB physique pro Craig Capurso―you'll be on track to make big muscle gains. <br><br>

So what are you waiting for? Let's get bigger!
<br><br>

1
 LIFT BIG BY WARMING UP FIRST <br><br>
Remember, a warm muscle is better capable of lifting max weight―and less likely to become injured.
<br><br>
If you're looking to hoist serious poundages, you'll sabotage your chances if you short-change your warm-up. What's more, the stronger you are, the more warm-up sets you'll need. <br><br>

That helps not just the muscles push more weight but also the tendons and ligaments that have to support that heavier resistance as well. 
<br><br>
A good 5-10 minutes on the bicycle preceding your first light-weight sets is an effective way to kick off your training session and get the blood pumping. <br><br>

Remember, a warm muscle is better capable of lifting max weight―and less likely to become injured.
<br><br>

2
 REPS FOR MUSCLE<br><br>
A common question every beginner asks is, "How much weight should I use?" The answer depends on your goals. Warm-up sets aside, when your goal is to build strength, your heavy sets should be done for fewer than six reps.
<br><br>
If your goal is building muscle, choose a weight at which you reach muscle failure between 8-12 reps. And for emphasizing muscle endurance, go with a weight that allows you to do more than 15 reps.
<br><br>

3
 PUMP UP THE VOLUME<br><br>
Some folks spend hours a day working on a single body part. Others insist they need only one set per exercise. So what's the best amount? While there's no magic number, doing 2-3 sets of a given move works best for most beginners; 3-4 sets for more advanced athletes. <br><br>

The focus here is on volume―the total number of sets and reps completed for a given muscle group. Bodybuilding for muscle growth concentrates on fairly high volume, though too much risks overtraining. 
<br><br>
Start off with about 12 sets total―say, 3 sets of 4 exercises―for larger muscle groups like chest, back, and legs, and 6-8 for smaller ones. 
<br><br>
As you progress, you can handle more sets (volume), but you'll want to extend the number of days before you train that body part again.<br><br>


4
 ADOPT AN ATHLETIC STANCE<br><br>
When getting into position on standing exercises, do what athletes in all sports do: Adopt an athletic stance. Your feet should be about shoulder-width apart, toes pointed slightly outward, knees bent (soft), torso erect (chest out, shoulders back, low back slightly arched) with your head looking forward. 
<br><br>
This is a natural, stable, and strong position, and it should be a starting point for you when get into position for almost any standing exercise.
 <br><br>



5
 DON'T BE IN A HURRY<br><br>
"Make sure you're taking ample recovery time between sets in a mass-gain phase," says Craig Capurso, IFBB pro physique competitor and Cellucor athlete. "I don't look to limit rest times when max muscle growth is the name of the game. I want to be recovered enough to push the weight as many times as I can, not stopped by a muscle that's not sufficiently recovered from the previous set. You need sufficient rest in between sets to be able to push maximal loads."
<br><br>

6
 OVERLOAD AND GROW<br><br>
In your efforts to stimulate muscle, you need to be somewhat aggressive. Muscle fibers adapt fairly quickly, and the effectiveness of a once-challenging workout can quickly fade. This means you should continually increase the challenge―so long as you maintain good form―and never fall into a comfort zone. 
By progressively increasing the overload over time, you'll continue to make gains in size and strength. For most lifters, changes to their training programs helps keep workouts fresh.

<br><br>
7
 FLIP YOUR GRIP<br><br>
Speaking of making changes, one very easy and effective way to do so is to simply try a different grip from what you're used to. If you've typically done an exercise with a wide, overhand grip, flip it and use an underhand grip instead. This approach can work with bench presses, lat pulldowns, bent-over rows, barbell curls, and triceps pushdowns, among other exercises.<br><br>


8
 GET GROUNDED<br><br>
We've all seen him: the poor guy doing curls while teetering on a wobble board like Mr. Magoo in an earthquake. Strength training is important, and so is balance. But when you're trying to add size, keep them separate. Forget about doing squats on wobble boards, dumbbell presses on exercise balls, or standing on one leg while curling a weight.
<br><br>
Besides making you looking like a fool, neither your core nor the target body part will be fully stimulated. Your best bet is to focus on one activity one day, and the other the next. Besides, you'll be able to push much more weight when grounded on a stable surface.<br><br>


9
 GET MILE-WIDE<br><br>
Few of us were born with low body-fat levels that give us that natural V-taper, so how do you create the illusion of a small waist if you've got a more blocky physique? Emphasize your upper back and middle delts to a greater degree in your workouts. <br><br>
Do a few more sets of wide-grip movements on back day, and a few extra sets of upright rows and lateral raises on shoulder day. Bonus: The width will make your waist appear smaller.
<br><br>

10
 DUMBBELL ADVANTAGE<br><br>
Sure, you have a number of training options when it comes to doing a particular exercise, but if you want the biggest challenge, opt for dumbbells. Unlike with barbells and most machines, which allow a stronger side to dominate, dumbbells require both sides of the body to do an equal amount of work. 
<br><br>
Dumbbells are also especially easy to get to when the gym is busy during the early evening. If you've been favoring particular barbell exercises, achieve a slightly different training stimulus by substituting its dumbbell cousin.
<br><br>

11
 CHEAT REPS CAN COUNT<br><br>
A lot of folks at the gym use bad form, which usually puts pressure on surrounding joints while taking stress off the target muscle. But when done right, cheat reps can make the target muscle work harder. The purpose of cheating is to stimulate the muscle fibers with greater intensity, not less.
<br><br>
That's best done by completing 6-8 reps on your own with good form, then adding just enough momentum to pass the sticking point for a few more reps. If you have to cheat right from the very first rep, though, the weight's too heavy.
<br><br>

12
 RUNNING THE RACK <br><br>
Dropsets are a time-tested approach that really ignites a muscle burn.
<br><br>
Dropsets (repping to failure, then continuing with progressively lighter weight) are a great way to induce a deep muscle burn on the last set of a given exercise, and are especially useful for precontest bodybuilders looking to burn a few extra calories. Dropsets are a time-tested approach that really ignites a muscle burn. 
<br><br>
For example, if you're curling with 35-pound dumbbells, do your set, then immediately place the weights back on the rack and grab the 30s. Do as many reps as you can, then replace and repeat with the 25s.
<br><br>
Squeeze out as many as you can―and it may not be very many―all the way down until you reach the 15s. Light weight never felt so heavy!<br><br>


13
 PUT YOUR MOVEMENTS IN 
REVERSE<br><br>
What makes the deadlift from the floor different from other exercises? You do it from a dead stop. With other exercises, you generate elastic energy―the energy that helps you lift the weight during the initial stages―when you reverse direction at the bottom. When you remove that elastic energy by momentarily resting the bar on the floor, the movement is much harder. This is also a great way to build strength over the lower portion of the range of motion. 
<br><br>
Try this: Set the safeties in a power rack at the lowest point in the range of motion for a given move (i.e., the bottom of your squat). Each rep begins from the bottom―not the top. Make sure you momentarily let the bar settle on the safeties on each rep before pressing back up to remove that elastic tension.
<br><br>

14
 OPPOSITES ATTRACT<br><br>
Supersetting two exercises is a common method to speed up your workouts, but when you do it for opposing muscle groups, research shows you can get an added bonus: You'll be slightly stronger than normal on the second exercise in the grouping. Pair exercises for antagonist muscle groups: biceps/triceps, back/chest, and quads/hamstrings.
<br><br>

15
 PRE-EXHAUST TO WORK AROUND WEAK LINKS <br><br>
Most of the "big" exercises you do are called compound or multijoint movements―exercises that allow you to push the most weight because more than one muscle group is involved. When doing these kinds of movements, the set commonly ends when one of the muscle groups reaches failure.<br><br>
Pre-exhaust training is an approach that gets around the "weak link in the chain" that brings about premature failure. For example, when bench pressing, the smaller triceps often give out before the larger pecs muscles. To bypass this limitation, first do an isolation exercise like the dumbbell fly, which places very little stress on the triceps. This "pre-exhausts" the chest muscles. <br><br>

Because the chest has already been worked, the triceps are no longer the weaker muscle by the time you do bench presses and you can do the exercise to true pectoral failure rather than triceps failure.
<br><br>

16
 DO YOUR WOKROUT IN REVERSE <br><br>
What's the easiest way to do a workout makeover? Try doing it in reverse order. You'll still want to start with a good warm-up, but then go right into what's normally your last exercise. You'll be surprised by how much stronger you are when doing it first, because it isn't prefatigued, and you'll be able to do more weight for more reps. 
<br><br>
Naturally, when you get to the movements you typically do first, you won't be able to go as heavy or for as many reps. Ultimately, you'll work the target muscle in a way it's unaccustomed to, which is a great way to kick-start muscle growth. 
<br><br>

17
 A FINISHING PUMP <br><br>
"For max muscle recruitment, use a high-volume approach," says Capurso. "When I use a very low rep range, I feel like I'm leaving more in the tank. So I've adopted an approach that will be mentally and physically challenging in my attempt to push a load till failure. Most people will fail in the lower rep ranges and feel satisfied, but try taking the challenge of doing multiple sets in the 15-18-rep range. You'll find yourself completely fatigued by the end." 
<br><br>
Research also supports the idea of adding one last back-off set with a lighter weight you can do for higher reps, flushing the muscle with blood and water to increase strength and muscle size. 
<br><br>

18
 SPEED UP YOUR GAINS<br><br>
At the end of a set when fatigue is setting in, using a slightly more explosive motion can help you do an extra rep or two when you otherwise might have racked the weight. <br><br>
Remember to use a strong and controlled rep speed when starting out a set; once you near that last rep or two, start generating a bit more momentum to help you blast through sticking points.
<br><br>

19
 TRAIN LIKE AN EGYPTIAN <br><br>
Rather than opting for same ol' three sets of 10 on a given movement, try pyramiding your weight on successive sets, stepping up the weight a bit each time. Of course, the number of reps you can do necessarily falls as the weight increases, but you'll realize better gains in strength with the lower-rep sets. Just make sure you don't burn yourself out on lighter-weight sets; don't encroach on muscle failure until you hit your heaviest sets.
<br><br>

20
 DOUBLE YOUR GAINS<br><br>
What's the best way to continue making gains? By finding a workout partner who pushes you, especially one who is bigger and stronger than you. Besides spotting you and assisting with forced reps and partials to help you train past failure, a training partner will also motivate you to hit the gym on days you might otherwise opt for the sofa. 
<br><br>
If you're stuck training on your own, you can still benefit from training past muscle failure; try these selected intensity-boosting techniques that work especially well for single trainers.
<br><br>

21
 GET BELTED<br><br>
Weight belts aren't seen as much in gyms as they used to be, but every serious lifter should have one. While you shouldn't be wearing it on every set―you need to strengthen your lower back muscles―they should be worn on especially heavy sets in which your lower back needs support. <br><br>
I'm talking deadlifts, bent-over rows, standing military presses, and squats. Skip the belt on your lighter-weight sets so your low back has to work and can therefore grow stronger.
<br><br>

22
 BAND-AIDS<br><br>
Using powerlifting bands and chains may appear unnecessary or inconvenient, but they can help you can realize big-time gains, especially when your muscles are unaccustomed to using them. What's unique about these tools is that they provide variable resistance over the course of a single rep. 
<br><br>
In the down position, the bands and chains unload some of the weight on the floor and are therefore lighter; as you press up, the tension on the target muscles increases. Bands and chains are a great way to attack a sticking point.
<br><br>

23
 STRAP IN 
<br><br>
 

Wrist Wraps
 <br><br>
Support wrist integrity during monster lifts! Get high quality wrist wraps for the best performance in the gym. 
<br><br>
Get It Now!
<br><br>

You've been told never to use wrist straps, so you can work your grip on back day? Nonsense! Once your grip starts to become fatigued, put on those pulling straps. You'll find you can do an extra rep or two on each set, which means greater muscle growth.
<br><br>
Don't worry about forearm or grip development; do that on arm day. When it's back day, focusing on pushing as much weight for as many reps as you can―and that means using straps.
<br><br>

24
 REST TO GROW<br><br>
Though this is in no way a "training technique", many lifters determined to continue to push harder in their pursuit of growth actually undermine their efforts by including too few rest days in their training split. Don't be so obsessed with missing a workout and training to utter exhaustion that you fail to give your body enough time to actually heal―and grow.
<br><br>
Likewise, levels of catabolic hormones like cortisol rise quickly in the body over the course of a training session; you should strive to get in the gym and get it done quickly. Work on increasing your workout intensity rather than duration. 
<br><br>
25
 HIT IT AGAIN<br><br>
The frequency with which you should train a particular muscle depends in part on how much work (volume) you're doing. Beginners who don't do a lot of sets for a given body part can train them more frequently (say every 2-3 days). More advanced lifters who do 15-20 sets for a given muscle group can follow a split in which they train each muscle group every 5-6 days. <br><br>

Competitive bodybuilders who often train balls-to-the-wall might go seven days or more before repeating a workout. In these cases, it literally takes that long for the muscle to fully recover between training sessions.

<br><br>
26
 GO FOR THE "BIG" MOVES FIRST <br><br>
When looking for the best exercise to start your workout with, steer toward multijoint exercises; you can lift the most weight early in your workouts, when your energy levels are high. They're called multijoint―or compound―because more than one set of joints is working, which recruits additional muscle groups.
<br><br>
For example, the bench press recruits the triceps and front delts in addition to the pecs. Squats, bent-over rows, overhead presses, and bench presses are the best muscle builders for the legs, back, shoulder, and chest, respectively. Add on other exercises from different angles to fully work a target muscle. <br><br>
Bonus tip: Really challenge yourself with weights you can only do for 6-8 reps early in your workout; once fatigue starts to set in, you won't be able to push those very heavy weights any longer.
<br><br>

27
 SPLIT WISELY<br><br>
When devising your training split, be careful about training a given muscle group on consecutive days because―say it with us―a muscle grows when it's being rested in the presence of good nutrition. If you train chest on Mondays, shoulders on Tuesdays, and triceps on Wednesdays, your split doesn't allow ample recovery time. Training back or biceps on consecutive days is also a sign of a poorly designed split. Use rest days and leg days to break up your upper-body training days.
<br><br>

28
 ADJUST YOUR LIFESTYLE TO YOUR GOALS<br><br>
Gaining mass is all about taking in more calories than you burn while following the specific training advice presented here. However, if you're a party animal and consume too many of the wrong calories from alcohol or greasy fast foods, you'll sabotage your efforts. 
<br><br>
Make sure your extracurricular activities (i.e., everything you do outside the gym) are in sync with your diet and your training in order to make the fastest possible gains!

第一部分：预备<br><br>
如今提到“健身”与“力量”，人们想到的就是那些笨重的、充了气一样的健美运动员，
还有健身房、花哨的训练器械、营养补剂和各种药物。<br><br>
以前并不是这样的。<br><br>
曾经有一段时间，男人们练出超人的力量，但除了自己的身体之外，他们什么都没有。<br><br>
如果你想了解更多其中的真相，那么读下去……<br><br>
第一章力量之旅<br><br>
启程<br><br>
走进世界上任何一间健身房，你都会发现一堆用类固醇“催肥”、自以为很强壮的家伙
――因为他们的臂围可达45 厘米、他们能卧推起重重的杠铃、他们的身型看上去无比壮硕，
尤其是穿上紧身背心或T 恤衫时。<br><br>
但是在这些人当中，有多少人真正强大有力呢？<br><br>
・多少人具有真正的能派上用场的运动能力呢？<br><br>
・多少人能俯身来20 个完美的单臂俯卧撑呢？<br><br>
・多少人的脊椎足够强健、灵活、健康，能够后弯腰摸到地板呢？<br><br>
・多少人能单靠膝盖和臀部的力量单腿径直下蹲至地面再站起来呢？<br><br>
・多少人能抓住高过头顶的横杆来一个毫无瑕疵的单臂引体向上呢？<br><br>
答案是：<br><br>
几乎没有。<br><br>
你会发现，今天在任何一家健身房里锻炼的健美者几乎没有一个能完成这些简单的动
作。然而，现在的媒体和大众却将健身房里那些身材臃肿的装腔作势之徒视为力与美为象征。
那种体形已经成为公认的终极健康的标志，这在我看来简直荒谬之极。一个人宣称他在
健身房里能举起多重的杠铃，这有什么意义？如果他连自己的身体都无法运用自如，那他又
怎么配得上“强壮”二字呢？<br><br>
强壮起来<br><br>
如今，大多数在健身房锻炼的瘾君子都中看不中用。这些人可能有刻意练出的、粗大的
四肢，但那种粗大只是来自于肌肉组织，其实他们的肌腱和关节非常弱。让一个大决头做单
腿深蹲（屁股挨地的那种）不超过两次，他的膝盖韧带就会难以消受。大多数健身者确实有
力量，但他们不会协调地运用自己的力量。如果让他们倒立行走，他们就会掉个嘴啃泥。<br><br>
那些渴望变得强壮有力的现代人竟然不惜花费不菲的费用去办昂贵的健身卡，而仅仅是
为了使用哑铃、杠铃和其他的“玩具”。看到他们，我不知该哭还是该笑。我该笑是因为这
是一个完美的骗局，健身业骗了全世界的人，让大家以为没有器械就不能健身。然后，就会
有人买下这些器械或以高昂的价格将其出租。而我该哭则是因为这根本就是一出悲剧，普通
的健身者（不使用类固醇）年复一年地锻炼，身材变化却微乎其微，甚至还损失了一些真正
的运动能力。<br><br>
健身业和大量的广告会不间断地给你洗脑，让你以为没有那些器械就不能健身。但事实
上，要想孔武有力根本无需哑铃、拉力器、花哨的器械或其他废物。其实，在不使用任柯特
殊器械的情况下你完全可以变得像赫拉克勒斯（Hercules）一样力大无穷，真正有力量、有
活力。不过，要想开发真正属于自己身体的力量，你先得知道如何去做，你需要正确的方法.
真正的技艺。<br><br>
更多资讯，请访问：<a href= "http://www.retter2012.com" title="点击进入"> retter2012.com </a>。<br><br>
我所说的这种方法其实一直都在。它是在古代传统训练方法的基础上建立的；它历经数
百年的时间逐渐形成，并在无数次实践中得到一次又一次的验证；它具有将弱不禁风之人锻
造成钢铁战士的超级能力。这就是“升级式体操”―种运用人类的身体使之发展到极致的技
艺。今天，体操被视为一种有氧运动或肌肉耐力训练，不为人重视。但在过去，即20 世纪
下半叶之前，世界上最强壮的运动员都是通过练习“升级式体操”让自己日复一日、年复一
年地变得更强壮、更有力的。<br><br>
被人遗忘的自身体重锻炼<br><br>
很不幸，你在任何健身房都学不到这门技艺。现如今（其实就是最近），绝大多数运动
员对此技艺都闻所未闻。上世纪，有诸多新健身法开始流行，它们都要借助一定的健身器材，
比如杠铃、哑铃、拉力器或其他新玩意儿。从那时起人们开始幼稚地迷恋于各种器材，这样
一来用自身体重锻炼的方法就被无情地挤出了局。有关如何恰当地练习休操的知识，几乎被
健身器材制造商的宣传广告挤压得没有一点儿空间。其实那些商人就是想让你相信，没有他
们的产品你就没法训练身心。<br><br>
受到这些影响，体操的传统技艺已经降级为“孩子”的健身方法。今天的体操动作包括
俯卧撑、引体向上、深蹲等，这些都是很好的练习动作。但是在做这些动作的过程中你没有
负重，所以反复做虽然可以提高你的耐力，但不会使你的力量大大增强。真正的传统体操―
―即“老派”体操――大师，都知道该如何训练才能激发出一个人最大、最纯粹的力量，这
种力量远远超过一般健身者通过杠铃或组合器械锻炼出来的。我见过一些通过‘老派，体操
锻炼的人，他们都强壮有力，甚至能徒手弄断钢制手铐、撕开铁栅栏。如果让他们在墙上打
一拳，那足以让砖块碎裂。<br><br>
你想拥有这种“超凡”的身体力量吗？<br><br>
在本书中我会教你如何实现这一目标，不过不是去健身房或者狂做俯卧撑，那样都无法
实现你的愿望。只有了解了如何练习“老派”体操，你才能释放自己身体中最原始的力量。<br><br>
我师出何门<br><br>
很幸运，“老派”体操的那一套还存在，但只存在于那些黑暗的地方。在那里，一个人
只有足够强大才可保命，但那里可能根本没有杠铃、哑铃以及其他现代化的健身器械。我说
的“那里”就是监狱、拘留所、劳改机构以及不管什么名字，只要是文明人关押粗野之人的
地方就行。<br><br>
我叫保罗・威德，说来惭愧，我对监狱生活了如指掌。1979 年，我第一次犯罪便进了
圣昆汀（San Quentin ）州立监狱，此后的23 年中，有19 年我都是在美国几所管教极为严
酷的监狱中度过的，其中包括安哥拉监狱（又名安哥拉劳改营，AngolaPenitentiary）和马里
恩监狱（Marion）―残酷程度与“人间地狱”恶魔岛监狱（Alcatraz）不相上下。<br><br>
我很了解“老派”体操，或许现在没有人比我知道得更多。在我服刑的最后一段日子中，
大家给我起了个绰号“Entrenador“，这是西班牙语，意思是“教练”，因为新来的菜鸟都会
到我这里学习如何在很短的时间内变强大。我也因此得到很多人的拥护，并收到他们给的不
少好处。我觉得自己受之无愧，因为我的方法行之有效，我能做12 个自由单臂倒立撑――
至今我还没见过有其他人能做到，即使把获得过奥运会体操冠军的运动员也算在内。在监狱
中，我们每天轮班干体力活―让囚徒在农场千活是一种减少麻烦的有效手段，一天活干下来
人通常会筋疲力尽，自然也就没精神再打扰狱警了。我曾连续6 年获得安哥拉监狱俯卧撑/
引体向上年度大赛冠军，这项比赛是由一名囚徒创办的。1987 年，我还参加了加利福尼亚
举重锦标赛并获得了季军，其实我从未接受过举重训练，我只是因为跟人打赌才参加比赛的。<br><br>
多年以来，我始终坚持用自己的方法进行锻炼，我都记不清有多少年了。不过，这套锻炼方
法的确让我的身体变得特别健壮。20 年来，我不得不与退伍老兵、变态和疯子等为伍。由
于生活所迫，这些家伙大都会努力锻炼，但绝大多数都没我强壮。另外，世界上一些颇有成
就的运动员其实也曾是罪犯，所以你可能并没有在健身杂志上看到过关于他们的健身方法的
介绍。<br><br>
服刑期间，我一直努力使自己变得强壮并保持最好的状态。竭尽全力锻炼，成了我唯一
的目标，只不过我不是在舒适的健身房里―周围没有镀铬的健身器械，没有晒得黑黝黝的装
腔作势之徒，也没有身裹弹性纤维的妩媚女人。我也不像今天大多数私人教练那样，通过3
周的课程就获得教练资格。我绝对架笼某些肥猪作家，一辈子没有一天汗流侠背地度过，却
拼凑出很多有关健康或健身的书籍。我也不是什么天才运动员。第一次狱中受伤，发生在我
22 岁生日后的第3 周。当时我体重68 千克，身高186 厘米，我的手臂瘦长，看上去就像烟
斗通条，甚至还不及通条结实。有了早些时候的险恶经历，我很快就认识到囚徒们恃强凌弱
就像呼吸一样平常，而遭到恐吓更是家常便饭。我不希望自己成为任何人的“表纸”。我认




识到要想不成为别人的目标，最安全、最有效的方法就是让自己变强，面且要快。<br><br>
很走运，进到圣昆汀监狱几周之后，我就被安排与一名前海豹突击队员同在一间囚室。
他受过军事训练，体形健硕。他教我做一些基本的健身动作，如俯卧撑、引体向上、深蹲。
我学到了做这些动作的正确方法，仅仅跟他训练几个月后我的块头就增大了不少。每天在囚
室里锻炼，我的体能提升很快，不久之后有些动作便能做上数百个了。我想让自己变得更强
大，为了达到这一目标我不遗余力。我向我能找到的每一个人学习，在我的狱友中有体操运
动员、军人、举重运动员、习武者、瑜伽练习者、摔跤运动员，甚至还有几位医生。<br><br>
那时，我根本没机会进健身房，我只能在囚室中徒手锻炼。所以，我得尝试各种不同的
锻炼方式，努力让自己的身体成为一间健身房。锻炼成了一种“药”，而我也沉浸其中无法
自拔。6 个月后，我的块头和力量就大有长进。1 年之内，我就跻身监狱中身体最强壮者的
行列―这全靠传统体操。这种锻炼方法在监狱外早已无人问津，而在监狱里，与之相关的知
识却“代代相传”。这是因为对囚徒而言，很少有别的方法可以用―那里既没有普拉提课，
也没有跑步机。现在，很多人都在谈论监狱里的健身房，但老实说直到最近几年监狱里才设
立了健身房，而且设备也相当破旧。<br><br>
在我的狱友中，有一位名叫乔・哈提根（Joe Hartigen）的无期徒刑犯，是我的良师益
友。我认识他时，他已经71 岁了，并且已经在狱中度过了30 多年。他上了年纪，身上还有
很多伤，尽管如此，他还是坚持每天早晨都在囚室里锻炼。他非常强壮，我见过他只用两根
食指做负重引体向上，只用一根大拇指做单臂俯卧撑，而他做这些时甚至都不见费力。他比
那些所谓的“专家”更了解健身。他那强壮的身体是在20 世纪上半叶的老式健身房里练出
来的，那时大多数人听都没有听过可以更换杠铃片的杠铃。那些家伙大多用自身体重锻炼，
他们的锻炼方法如今被视为体操的一部分，而不属于力量训练。当然，他们也使用“器械”，
但不是躺在可调节的舒适座椅上，而是要拖拉又大又不规则的物体，如加载重物的桶、铁砧、
沙袋或其他人。像这样的负重训练涉及很多与力量有关的重要因素――如抓握耐力、肌腿强
度、速度、平衡、协调和野性魄力，这些在现代健身房里都已消失不见了。<br><br>
这种锻炼法竟然可以使老前辈的身体如此强壮。20 世纪30 年代，乔在圣路易斯与“铁
臂阿童木”（The Mighty Atom）共同锻炼.“铁臂阿童木”是有史以来最著名的大力士之一，
身高只有163 厘米，体重约64 千克。“铁臂阿童木”是一个奇迹，他的日常表演会令众多的
现代健美者哭着去找妈妈。他能挣脱铁索、徒手把大钉子钉进松木板里，还能把小钉子咬成
两半。1928 年，他仅仅通过拉住了拴在飞机上的一根绳子，就成功地阻止了飞机起飞（他
甚至都犯不上用手，只是把绳子系在了头发上）。与现代健身房里的鼠辈不同，“铁臂阿童木”
的身体的任何地方都强壮无比，而且他能在任何地方证明这一点。他所做的另一件令人惊叹
的事便是不用工具给小汽车换轮胎―他可以徒手拧开车轮上的螺栓，然后再抬起汽车，把备
用轮胎装上。在20 世纪30 年代中期，他遭到六个魁梧的货轮装卸工的袭击，结果这六个家
伙被收拾得很惨，还进了医院。幸运的是，他本人没有因此而进监狱，因为把铁条像发卡一
样弄弯对他来说是再平常不过的事情。这些都是类固醇流行之前那个时代的传奇。“铁臂阿
童木”也像乔一样，不需要借助骗人的肌肉药物，而直到晚年他还强壮得令人胆寒。事实上，
80 岁之前他一直在进行大力士表演。在经济大萧条的年代，乔认识了许多大力士，还与其
中一些人一同锻炼过。在狱中，他经常给我讲那些“强人轶事”，如今这些世界顶级强人的
名字早已消失在了历史的漫漫长河之中。<br><br>


我能大量地接触并学习他们的锻炼哲学真是非常幸运。比如，乔就强调了这样一个事实：
过去很多人都是用自身体重训练来真正强壮体魄的。当然，为了展示力量，他们也要借助外
物―如铁桶和钉子，但大多数时候，他们都是通过控制自己的身体来增强自身的力量。事实
上，乔憎恨杠铃和哑铃。在监狱的餐厅中他经常对我说：“如今，人们试着用杠铃和哑铃让
自己的块头变大，这真是愚蠢。其实，用自己的身体就可以练就让人刮目相看的体格，而这
就是古希腊和古罗马运动员的训练方法。看看那个时代流传下来的雕像，那些家伙的肌肉比
今天用药物催长的象续的还大，而且更令人难忘。”确实如此，看看拉奥孔（收藏于梵蒂冈）
和赫拉克勒斯这两座雕像你就能明白。在艺术家创作这些雕像时充当模特的古代运动员的肌
肉显然非常发达，我想他们即使来到现在，也很容易就能赢得健美比赛的冠军。其实直到
19 世纪人们才发明了可配重的杠铃。要是这些事实还不足以让你赞同我的观点，那你可以
看一看现代的男性体操运动员，这些人几乎都在用自身体重锻炼。在他们之中，很多人的体
格都足以令许多健美者汗颜。<br><br>
虽然乔已经离我而去了，但我向他保证过，他传授给我的训练智慧绝不会失传。那其中
的很大一部分都写在这本书中了。安息吧，乔！<br><br>
学成出师<br><br>
这些年里，我有机会观察到上千个囚徒的锻炼，有的在院子里的力量训练区（如果监狱
有的话），有的在囚室里。我和许许多多行家都聊过―很多都是精英级的强人。对他们而言，
锻炼就是一种信仰，一种生活方式。这么说并没有夸大其词。这些年，我学到很多有关健身
的秘诀和技巧，并把它们慢慢融人了我的体系。我和其他狱友一样，从监狱生活中意识到了
身体强健的重要性，因为狱中很少有安全舒适的生活。我不断地付出努力与汗水，尝试着把
听到的健身知识转换成具体的实践。为了亲自验证各种信息的正确性，我一天都没停过。所

以，在众多的狱友中我以沉迷于锻炼、时刻保持巅峰状态而著称。有我参与的事情总是速战
速决，因为我的力量很好、爆发力极强。久而久之，我便成了一个传奇。很自然地，我比没
有锻炼的时候获得了更多尊敬，甚至还因为这样的生活方式和能力获得了某些狱警的赞誉。
90 年代，我在马里恩监狱服刑，两名狱警被谋杀，之后那里便采用了永久封杀的管理方法
（“永久封杀”的意思是，所有囚徒每天都有23 个小时是被单独监禁的，天天如此）。为避
免再出差错，警卫每40 分钟便巡逻一次。在马里恩，有个不胫而走的笑话：有一次，警卫
看见我在做俯卧撑，40 分钟后他再次巡逻的时候看见我还在做俯卧撑，而且是完全相同的
动作。<br><br>
在服刑的最后几年中，作为健身强人的我名声大震，每天都有很多人（主要是新来的囚
徒）来找我，让我当教练。他们都听说我能让他们在短时间内变成狱中硬汉，而且我的收费
适中。他们想学到失传的技艺（在监狱外确实难得一见），想学会如何练出足以震慑人的肌
肉、强大的体能、野兽般的体魄和强悍的力量―在不使用器械的情况下，因为他们中的大多
数地位太低，不能进人院子里的力量训练区锻炼。<br><br>
我在狱中教过上百个囚徒，也因此获得了很多宝贵的经验，这些经验是我无法通过自己
单独锻炼而获得的。我知道了如何将自己的技巧应用于具有不同体型和不同新陈代谢能力的
人身上，也了解到一些会影响健身的精神因素，如不同的人有不同的健身动机。我因此得以

“老派”体操<br><br>
如今，体操一词，在健身界已不太常被提及了。体操这个词（calisthenics）直到19 世
纪才开始在英语中出现，它其实源于古老的希腊语“kallos“（意为美）和“sthenos”―― （意
为力）。<br><br>
简单地说，体操是用自身体重与身体惯性锻炼身体的一种技艺。本书介绍的锻炼体系，
实际上是体操的高级形式，它能使人的力量与运动能力得到最大限度的增强。可惜的是.现
代人并不认为体操是一种实打实的力量训练方法。如今，一提到体操，大多数人只会想到反
反复复的俯卧撑、仰卧起坐以及难度不大的开合跳、原地踏步等动作。体操已经成了人们健


身的次要选择和成本低廉的有氧运动。其实体操的“命运”并非一直如此。<br><br>

古老的自身体重训练法<br><br>
人类很早就知道，正确利用自身体重进行锻炼既可以塑造完美的身材，也可以打造强悍
的力量。在史前时期，当早期人类想增强并展示自己的身体能力时，他们会利用自己对身体
的控制力。他们会将身体向上拉起、屈膝跳跃，还会借助手臂的力量把身体推离地面。这些
动作最终演化成了体操的基本动作。<br><br>
古人绝没有把体操视为一种耐力训练方法，而是将其视为一种力量训练体系。体操也是
优秀的战士用以增强战斗力、打造令人胆寒的肌肉的手段。<br><br>

现存的、关于体操的较早记录之一出自古希腊历史学家希罗多德（Herodotus）之手，
他叙述了这样一件事：在温泉关之战（约公元前480 年）之前，波斯大军在人数上占有绝对
优势，波斯国王薛西斯一世（Xerxes ）派一队侦察兵俯视山谷中的对手―由国王李奥尼达
（Leonidas）率领的斯巴达战士。让薛西斯一世惊讶的是，侦察兵回来报告说斯巴达士兵正
忙着做体操训练，看上去就像是为即将到来的战争活动筋骨。薛西斯一世觉得很可笑，因为
在山谷之外有超过12 万的波斯大军，而斯巴达一方只有300 人。他向斯巴达人发出通碟，
命其撤走，不然就将其全部消灭。斯巴达人严词拒绝了，而在之后的战斗中，这300 名斯巴
达战士成功地把庞大的波斯军队拖在了狭窄的关内，直到其他希腊势力联合起来。在扎克・
施奈德（Zac Snyder）拍摄的史诗电影《斯巴达300 勇士》（2007 年）中，我们也可以领略
这场战争的壮观。<br><br>
斯巴达人一直被认为是最强悍的民族，他们非常重视体操锻炼―这是他们能成为卓越战
士的重要原因。在古希腊，不只斯巴达人热爱体操。据帕萨尼亚斯（Pausanius）记载：在最
初的奥林匹克竞赛中，表现优秀的运动员（包括顶级拳击手、摔跤运动员以及古代大力士）
都是通过体操来锻炼身体的。留存于世的雅典陶器、镶嵌画以及建筑浮雕上的很多图画都明
白无地描绘了正式的体操训练场面，这些最初都是以奥林匹克运动员为模特创作的，而这些
运动员的体格则是通过体操锻炼达到了巅峰状态。古希腊人认为，体操可以使人的体格得到
最大限度的发展。通过体操锻炼，人的身体不会像今天众多健美者的那样丑陋肿胀，而会呈
现完美的比例，看起来自然而和谐。想要达到这种和谐状态并不难，因为体重本身就是一种
阻力，这种力不大亦不小，正是大自然的完美阻力：古希腊人知道，体操不仅能增强人的身
体力量和运动能力，也会使我们的动作更优雅、身材更优美。因此，体操一词在希腊语中是

“美”与“力”的结合。<br><br>
体操锻炼的技艺也同许多其他知识一样，由古希腊人传给了古罗马人。健身技艺的精髋
在角斗士（他们会在露天竞技场中搏杀）中间传承了下来。古罗马历史学家李维（Livy）描
述了那时的“超级战士”如何在训练营用自身体重日复一日地锻炼，他们当时的缎炼动作如
今被视为高级体操。据说，通过不断重复这些动作，角斗士会变得极为强壮。当时流传着一
种说法，认为这些大力士是凡间女子与泰坦族人（一个巨人族，在人类出现以前他们经常与
诸神交战）的私生子。通过战斗训练和做体操练就的身体是如此强健，从至于在公元前1
世纪，古罗马的角斗士差点儿毁灭了罗马帝国。当时，以斯巴达克斯为首的角斗士起义，想
要推翻罗马帝国的统治。尽管角斗士们的装备简陋，而且与罗马军队相比人数也少得可怜，
但他们的身体强健有力，最终庞大的罗马军队被打得溃不成军。<br><br>
毫无疑问，古人使用了许多不同体系的体操来锻炼身体。不过，从留存至今的文字与图
像中我们所能了解的是，那些极富传奇色彩的战士和运动员使用的自身体重训练法与今天广
为人们熟知的“体操”几乎没有一点儿相似之处―远不是一种软绵绵的有氧训练。而更像是
力量训练・事实上，他们的锻炼方法的确更适用于增强力量和爆发力。<br><br>
力量的传统<br><br>
在古典文明衰败之后.这种锻炼身体的方法持续了很长时间。如果有谁想变得更强壮。<br><br>
终极方式就是根据升级原则用自身体重锻炼。<br><br>
数百年后，古人的锻炼方法在拜占庭和阿拉伯半岛的军营中依然发挥着重要作用。此时，
好战的欧洲人比以往任何时候都更加渴望了解增强身体力量的方法。而十字军恰恰在这时将
这一套较为完善的力量训练体系从东方带到了欧洲。众所周知，要成为骑士就要进行身体训
练。有很多证据都表明，骑士们进行的那些训练其实就基于体操。如今，留存于世的有图案
的手稿和挂毯都表明，骑士会在树上或木制设备上做引体向上，还能倒立着表演力量特技动
作（看起来就像倒立撑）。中世纪的战士已经在进行没有杠铃和哑铃的力量训练了，这一事
实更是无须争辩。那时的西方军队具有不可思议的力量。据说，深受亨利五世赏识的长弓手
能将一棵树连根拔起。这可能有些夸张，但后来人们从亨利八世的“玛丽・罗斯”号军舰上
打捞上来一张长弓，其拉力据估计可达900 牛，相当于90 千克力。今天，没有一位弓箭手
能拉满这样的长弓。<br><br>
在整个文艺复兴时期，这些老方法还因在军事领域的广泛使用而继续传承，并且被游吟
诗人广为传颂。为了生计，杂技演员、歌手、杂耍艺人会在村庄、城镇、宫廷中表演力量特
技和体操。在启蒙运动时期，这一方法得以继续传播。<br><br>
19 世纪，仍然有很多人通过自身体重训练法来增强自己的身体力量。其实，如果说古
希腊时代是体育运动的第一个黄金期，那么19 世纪晚期无疑是第二个黄金期。在那个急剧
变动的时代，世界各地的健康专家认识到自身体重训练法具有卓越的价值，他们尝试着将这
一锻炼方法科学地记录下来。在普鲁士，富有传奇色彩的退役军官弗里德里希・路德维希・
雅恩（Friedrich Ludwig Jahn ），使自身体重锻炼变得正规。他创立的自身体重训练使用的
器械很少，只有横杆、双杠、鞍马、平衡木，于是大家熟知的“体操”就这样诞生了。在巡
游过程中表演力量特技这一传统在马戏团中延续了下来，大力士时代随之开启。大量杰出的
健美运动员在世界各地涌现，这一时期有很多具有传奇色彩的大力士，如亚瑟・萨克森
（Arthur Saxon）、罗兰多（Rolandow ），甚至包括尤金.山道（Eugen Sandow ），这些人壮
硕的体格成了“奥林匹亚健美先生”塑像的形象来源。他们是有史以来最强大的人，甚至比
那些使用类固醇的人还强。萨克森能单手举起175 千克的重物；罗兰多可以轻而易举地一下
撕碎3 副扑克牌，这几乎是无法想象的；而山道仅仅绷紧肌肉就挣断了缠在他身上的钢索。
这些人之所以如此厉害，体操功不可没。别忘了，杠铃和哑铃直到20 世纪才发明出来。在


这些健身器材问世之前，那些健美运动员十之八九是靠倒立和在横杆上锻炼来使自己上半身
的肌肉变得异常发达的。<br><br>

<a href= "pic75.html">太O拳-1（Taichi）</a><br><br>

20 世纪的传奇人物<br><br>
甚至直到20 世纪上半叶，很多力量领域的传奇人物也是通过自身体重训练法来锻炼的。<br><br>
那时，除非你能易如反掌地完成单腿深蹲、引体向上或双手倒立，否则就别说自己强壮。的
确，他们也会使用杠铃和哑铃，不过那都是在掌握自身体重训练法之后。<br><br>
当时，就连那些超级大块头都是高级体操的大师。英国人伯特・阿瑟拉堤（Bert Assirati）
从大力士选手转为摔跤运动员。他在上世经iii{年代名噪一时，就是因为体重超过110 千克
的他能让自己的身体后弯成桥状，再转成单手倒立。直到今天，能在吊环上表演“铁十字”
这一不可思议的高难度动作的人中，阿瑟拉堤仍然是最重的。<br><br>
上世纪四五十年代，世界上最强壮的人很可能是加拿大巨人道格・赫本（Doug
Hepburn ）。赫本被视为最伟大的推举者之一，他能挺举起重230 千克的物体；做颈后推举
时，能举起重约160 千克的物体。那时还没有类固醇和兴奋剂。尽管赫本的体重接近135
千克―几乎能压坏秤具，但他仍将自身体重训练视为力量训练的基本方法。赫本擅长举重，
他将自己异常强大的推举力归功于倒立撑。他常在锻炼时做无任何依靠的自由倒立撑，有时
还会在双杠上做，这样他就可以比在地面上做时降得更低。这位巨人证明，肌肉发达的身体
并不是练习体操的障碍。赫本的块头的确很大，但其肌肉并不僵硬，行动也不迟缓，因为他
始终认真地坚持自身体重训练，这种态度在现代健美人士身上很难看到。<br><br>

亚诺（Angelo Siciliano ），又名查尔斯・阿特拉斯（Charles Atlas）。他将传统体操与一些静
力练习技巧融合在了一起。整整一代人都通过他的漫画认识到，无需进行重量训练就能练就
不受人欺负的体格。<br><br>
但“老派”体操也就到这儿为止了。<br><br>

<a href= "pic75.html">太O拳-1（Taichi）</a><br><br>
时代终结<br><br>
20 世纪下半叶以来，许多古老的锻炼方法都被弃之不顾，慢慢消亡。这是工业革命造
成的直接后果。人类的生活与科技的结合越来越紧密，运动和力量训练领域也难逃此劫。人
类在20 世纪见证了全新的锻炼方法爆炸式的发展过程，我们对运动的态度也随之发生了翻
天覆地的变化。<br><br>
杠铃和哑铃是其中最核心的变化。杠铃已有数百年历史，但直到20 世纪英国运动员托
马斯・英奇（Thomas Inch）发明了可更换杠铃片的杠铃之后，它们才真正改变了健身的面
貌，很快拉力器与配重片也来凑热闹。不久之后，组合器械也出现并成为主流。20 世纪70
年代，没人不在健身器械上锻炼，诺德士（Nautilus）健身房遍布全美国。如今，世上任何
健身房，几乎都少不了复杂且令人费解的组合器械，甚至连杠铃和哑铃都不得不退居二线。<br><br>


那“老派”体操的境况又如何呢？尽管还有少数提倡者（如查尔斯），但它仍然慢慢淡出了
历史舞台。<br><br>
“老派”体操与“新派”体操的差异<br><br>
所有这些变化在极短的时间内改变了人们的运动方式，但可怕的是一些极有价值的东西
也随之消失了。数千年来―在人类历史的大部分时间里，那些想让自己变得强壮有力的人都
是使用自身体重训练法锻炼的。关于锻炼技巧的知识体系和深奥哲学代代相传，专注于力量
和爆发力、极其卓越而有效的锻炼方法慢慢进化。这些方法充满智慧，讲求循序渐进。它们
能让一个人变得越来越强壮，最后达到人类能力的极限―不仅在力量方面，还包括敏捷性、
运动能力和韧性三个方面。总之这些方法是无价的―我说到“老派”体操时，指的就是它们。
20 世纪下半叶，人们开始使用杠铃和哑铃锻炼，而那些来之不易的古老知识却无人问
津。现代人被新各式各样的健身器械及其使用方法所迷惑，继续通过“老派”体操锻炼的人
越来越少。<br><br>
今天，自身体重训练几乎被器械训练取代。它被视为这些新潮方法的懦弱同胞，只能靠
边站。“老派”体操的许多技巧与体系被弃之不用，慢慢也就衰败失传了，幸存下来的只有
一些最基本的东西。今天，当大家（甚至包括所谓的健身专家）谈到自身体重训练时，只是
涉及一些初级动作（如俯卧撑、深蹲），另外还增加了几个无用的现代动作，如卷腹。这些
练习都是为学龄儿童和体弱病残者设计的，普通健身者也可以用它们热身或增强耐力。与以
力量为基础的传统体操相比，这些动作可称为“新派”体操。如今，“老派”体操几乎不复
存在。<br><br>
几乎！<br><br>
监狱――“老派”体操的保险箱<br><br>
在一个地方，“老派”体操还没有绝迹。在那里，这种古老的锻炼体系就像困在琥珀中
的远古昆虫一样，保存完好。那个地方就是监狱。<br><br>
原因不言而喻。在监狱外，新式的锻炼方法层出不穷，“老派”体操早已被挤得没有生
存空间，但监狱里的情况大不相同。20 世纪五六十年代，拥有杠铃和哑铃的健身房在各地
风靡一时，监狱里却没有。直到70 年代末，粗陋的重量训练区才在监狱中出现，更别提那
些“不可或缺”的组合器械了―基本不会见到它们的身影。<br><br>
这就意味着，当力量训练在20 世纪遭遇“现代化”的巨大冲击时，监狱则像一个保险
箱。20 世纪前后，各种传统的锻炼方法在健身房的冲击下逐渐消失，但在监狱中，它们依
然存在，并没有因为科技和商业的飞速发展窒息而亡。18 一19 世纪，被监禁的那些家伙（体
操运动员、杂技演员、马戏团演员、大力士）知道如何借助自身体重进行训练并把这些知识
传授给了其他囚徒。这些知识在监狱里比黄金还珍贵，因为那里只有头顶的横杆、脚下的地
板，根本找不到任何健身器械。重要的是，体格强壮、动作敏捷对一个囚徒来说非常必要。
要知道，狱中的日子可不好过。<br><br>
如今的狱中生活很严酷，而100 年前的监狱生活则更加严酷。可以想象得出，挨打和虐
待是日常折磨的一部分，相互殴打造成重伤甚至致死简直是家常便饭。囚徒在牢房中进行力
量训练，说白了就是为了活命。他们玩命地锻炼，相当认真，对他们而言，是否强健有力关
乎生死。从这一点上看，这些囚徒无异于李奥尼达率领的斯巴达战士――他们要依靠自己的
能力保命。为了让自己变得更强，他们练习传统体操。<br><br>

囚徒健身的起源<br><br>
时至今日，世界各地的囚徒依然在用“老派”体操锻炼。在美国监狱服刑的这20 年中，
我对力量和健身的痴迷从未改变，于是体操就成为我生活的全部。人狱几年之后，我才开始
认识到富有成效的自身体重锻炼的本质与价值。此后的很多年中，我花了数年的时间去了解
相关的知识，包括深人、完整地了解老派体操的“秘密历史”，以及监狱在保存这些技艺过
程中所扮演的角色。<br><br>
在狱中，只要有关于锻炼和运动的资料―尤其是使用少量器械或不用器械来锻炼身体的
资料―我都会尽量阅读。我也有幸看到过数百位极其强壮的狱友是如何锻炼的，其中许多家
伙的本领都非常强。事实上他们之中有些人的身体素质完全可以与最优秀的运动员相媲美，
但由于他们特殊的经历以及生活在社会底层的原因，所以你在媒体上绝对不会看到他们的身
影，在杂志里也不会读到有关他们锻炼方法的介绍。我了解他们，并就各种锻炼方法和他们
进行过深人的讨论。我也有幸与一些前辈囚徒（他们都很老，老到见过老一代的大力士）成
为朋友，并相处了很长一段时间，听他们讲过自己的健身经历和理论。我遵照他们的指导，
用残酷的方法训练自己，不分昼夜，直到浑身疼痛难忍、双手破皮流血。我教过几百名囚徒，
这使我所掌握的健身知识能够在实践中趋于完善。<br><br>
多年来，我始终致力于研究“老派”体操，希望比其他人了解更多。数年后，我的笔记
写满了数十个本子，其中包括我在狱中学到的不同体系中最有价值的观念和技巧，并由此发
展出了体操的终极形式―无需准备特殊的器械、耗时少、简便易行，该方法可以循序渐进，
最终能使你变得像巨人般强健有力。<br><br>
这是我见过的最好的健身体系―“囚徒健身”。但它绝不仅仅适合囚徒，不管是谁，任
何想立于健康的巅峰并变得异常强大的人，都会从中大获裨益。<br><br>
熄灯！<br><br>
我发现，每当我和外面的人谈论这种刚毅、硬朗、能够将人推向极限的训练法时，对方
总会热血沸腾。毫无疑问，大家喜欢这些！在一次激烈讨论之后，一些举重运动员和田径运
动员满脸严肃地对我说，他们一定要掌握自身体重训练法。然而仅仅几周之后我就发现，他
们甚至就没尝试一下，而是依旧回到健身房，死心塌地扑在组合器械和自由重量上，和其他
人一样遵循那些徒劳无益的训练计划。<br><br>
我真的不是在责备他们，想让大家相信这样一套似乎都没人使用的方法真的很难。大多
数健身者需要见到大量的“证据”，才能真心地相信“老派”体操。他们需要了解这样一个
事实：现代健身法低效、昂贵、有害，而循序渐进的自身体重训练法则高效、免费、安全。
将来，“传统”方法一定会成为最前沿的方法。<br><br>
下一章中，我们将讨论体操与现代锻炼方法的差异。<br><br>

囚徒宣言<br><br>
无需去健身房，无需使用杠铃、哑铃、昂贵的器械和其他骗人的玩意儿，你就可以变得
孔武有力，我就是活生生的例子。在遍布全美国的监狱里，我的很多“徒弟”也可为证。
但我的方法与现代流行的方法相差很大，许多健身者都会对此法心存疑惑。我的观点之
所以与时代格格不人，原因是我来自监狱。那儿没有蛋白粉、没有可调节的杠铃、没有诺德
士或博飞（Bowflex）的组合器械，只有严酷的环境：在那里，你只有自己的身体和随处可
在的危险，以及大把的时间来打造肌肉，让自己变得更强大。我与很多狱友都实现了这一目


标，不过我们利用的是自己的身体，再加上古老的、经过数百年检验的传统技巧，而非依靠
那些各式各样的器械和花里胡哨的小玩意儿。<br><br>
有些人永远不会认为“老派”体操有效，因为他们已被洗脑，认为只有借助器械才能激
发自己的全部潜能。如果你打算接受我的方法，那就必须把之前接受的那些观点放在一边，
你至少得花点时间试试我这一套。这一章我会告诉你，为什么那些关于现代健身的东西都是
谎言或者说完全错误，为什么它们都在误导你。<br><br>
现代运动文化――丑陋的私生子<br><br>
我喜爱力量与健身。但当我看到监狱外人们的训练方法和体育运动的发展方向，我几乎
想重新回到圣昆汀监狱―敲开监狱冰冷的大门，直接走回囚室。“老派”体操已经绝迹，运
动文化也难逃此劫。在此之前，情况从未如此糟糕。<br><br>
亘古未有。<br><br>
有些人不同意我的观点，他们用一些优秀运动员和世界纪录保持者为证，证明健身方法
从来都没有像现在这般先进。但请稍等，还是别提那些电视上的运动比赛冠军和职业健美运
动员了。拜近来媒体报道所赐，一般公众开始相信这样的事实：大多数顶级运动员（不管你
信不信），只是因为服用了体能增强药物―如合成代谢类固醇、睾酮变体、人类生长激素、
胰岛素以及许许多多的其他药物，才（暂时）达到了高水平的体能。即使只是刚刚开始职业
生涯没几年，他们也会发现自己已经与止痛药、可的松、镇静剂以及其他使关节（暂时）应
付违反常理的训练与竞赛压力的药物形影不离了。这里还没提到在职业体育运动领域中泛滥
的麻醉药物，比如酒精、大麻、可卡因，甚至是冰毒，这些药物在运动界的使用如今已经极
为常见，那些意志薄弱的运动员无法适应比赛的压力，所以会求助于它们。那他们的训练方
法又如何呢？和你听过或读到过的故事不同，很少有职业运动员知道该如何好好锻炼。大多
数有天赋的运动员都是在高中阶段（甚至更小）就被挑选出来，接受“专业”的指导―教练
会为他们打点一切。<br><br>
干掉健身房！<br><br>
我们先把职业运动员和健美运动员的锻炼方法放在一旁，也暂时先忽略囚徒的锻炼方
法。其他人又是怎样的呢？
<br><br>

他们受杂志、电视节目、健身专家甚至政府卫生部门的影响，以为想要拥有好身材就得
去健身房。在健身房里他们会做些什么呢？一般来说，他们会做两件事：有氧训练与重量训
练――使用各种价格不菲的机器。<br><br>
我很难想出有比现代健身房里的有氧运动器械区更无用、更压抑、更乏味的地方了。大
家可能都见过用这些器械健身的健身会员，他们默默地假想自己在划船、在骑车或者在走上
根本不存在的台阶。我可以说这样几乎不会有什么货真价实的效果。<br><br>
那些进行重量训练的人又如何呢？在我眼里他们可以分为两种类型：第一种是常见的、
娇气的“塑形”者―他们采用低次数锻炼或拿起最小巧的哑铃，然后开始一遍遍地举起放下，
边做边数数。如果你穿着用弹力纤维制成的衣服在到处都是镀铬的健身器械周围摆造型，看
着也许还不错。但实话实说，这对你的健康毫无帮助。第二种就是进行重量训练的“刚健派”，
他们真的能做平卧推举（举起很重的重量），也有发达的肱二头肌。然而，这样的训练方法
会毁了他们的关节，而且对增强真正能用的力量毫无助益。现代健美训练忽略或者破坏了一
些身体部位，如竖脊肌、腰部、手脚、颈部以及人体的深层组织（如腹横肌或肩袖），而这
些部位对真正有用的力量和运动能力是至关重要的。很多人认为只要肌肉能把T 恤衫塞得
满满的就够了，果真如此吗？<br><br>
在毫无益处的训练组之间加人一些愚蠢的、病态的拉伸动作，这基本上就是健身房里的
标准程序了，你认为这就是健身了吗？<br><br>
现代健身的骗局<br><br>
我称赞任何一位离开沙发去锻炼的人，然而在那些众多去健身房锻炼的人中（你可能也
身在其中），有几个真正实现了自己的健身目标呢？事实令人高兴不起来，大多数人都会使
用上面描述的那些方法进行锻炼，结果却收效甚微。那些专注的家伙，一周一周“跋涉”到
健身房，但也许除了最初那一点点进步之外，在他们身上几乎看不出什么变化，更不用说达
到巅峰体能了。<br><br>
而这还是那些坚持锻炼的健身者的情况。90%的人会在两个月之后因为看不到效果而退出。考虑到毫无起色的瘦小身材、如此乏味的方法，谁还忍心指责那些失去动力的健身者呢？<br><br>
在50 年代的加利福尼亚，有些连锁健身房实行终身会员制度，而且价格适中。“终身”
的意思是只要一次付清应付款项，便可以随时来健身房训练，终身有效。听起来这是笔不错
的交易？确实不错，但那是对健身房老板而言。在众多花钱人会的人中，有99%都在数月
之后退出了，他们再也不愿意回来了。其实健身房老板深知这一点，这样的情况完全在他们
的预料之中。所以，健身房的退会率都高得出奇。<br><br>
你也这样吗？如果你曾经满怀激情，怀着美好的心愿走进过健身房，你也会在不久之后
便放弃吗？如果你不是这样，你也可能听过其他人有类似的经历。但是，如果去健身房锻炼
真如宣传的那样有价值，那为什么退会率会如此高呢？大家并没有通过锻炼达到他们期望的
效果，这应该是答案的一部分。<br><br>
健身房的普通健身日程不但没有效率，而且很不方便。不仅仅是训练，你首先要面对的
问题就是如何到达健身房。开办一家健身房需要有很大的空间，以便容纳足够多的器械。大
多数健身房老板都承担不起城市中心位置土地的租金，所以他们通常会在郊区或旧城区租下
或买下一片空地。这样一来，大多数健身者就不得不驱车或乘坐公共交通工具前往。出发前
你不但要准备运动服、健身包，还要带上会员卡、水以及洗浴用品等。有几个人在辛苦工作
一天或上完一天课之后还有心情准备这些东西呢？<br><br>
等你到健身房以后，你会发现自己想用的器械经常有人在使用―非工作时间这种情况更
常见。在到处都是满身臭汗的人的健身房里无所事事，可不会让人感到舒服（除非你有这种
特殊爱好）。<br><br>
那为什么大家还会自讨没趣呢？因为到处都在宣传―要想拥有完美的身材，就要去健身
房。要想成为别人瞩目的焦点，就要成为健身房会员；要想拥有分明的腹肌和发
达的胸大肌，就要借助那些昂贵的健身器械；要想避免运动损伤，就需要有专业的运动鞋；
要想块头大，就需要吃蛋白粉或其他营养品……为什么要告诉我们这些？各位，说到底，都
是为了钱。商业广告里的“专家”告诉你，想要锻炼胸大肌、腹肌或其他什么肌肉，就需要
这种或者那种器械。其实，他们就是以卖这些东西为生的家伙。营养补剂也同样如此，那些
以展示专业健美运动员并推广营养补剂为主要内容的杂志，并不是由健美爱好者资助的。职
业健美本身并没有想象的那么赚钱。这些杂志不是由生产这些营养补剂的公司赞助，就是由
这些公司出版的―后者占大多数。然而，这些出版物中那些健美者的健硕身材并不是蛋白粉
造就的，而是类固醇的功劳。<br><br>
在金钱驱使的现代社会中，商家向普通大众宣传的那些所谓的健康生活方式其实是一个
巨大的谎言。大多数消费者都陷人了骗局之中。其实，你不需要这些乱七八糟的产品就能使
自己的力量和健康状况达到巅峰状态。<br><br>
你需要的只有自己的身体、正确的知识，还有斩钉截铁的态度而已。<br><br>
用自身体重锻炼的好处<br><br>
为什么说“老派”体操与现代社会流行的、基于健身房的锻炼是两种完全不同的锻炼方
法呢？对这一问题，我可以大书特书。不过，篇幅有限，我打算只讲些两者的基本差别。我
总结出以下特别特别重要的六点。<br><br>
1、用自身体重锻炼需要的器械非常少<br><br>
绝没有一套力量训练体系能比用自身体重锻炼更符合“独立”与“精简”这两条原则了，
绝无仅有。就算热衷于重量训练的人也不得不承认这一点。<br><br>
对“老派”体操大师而言，他们的身体就是一座健身房。其实大多数体操动作都无需器
械，有时你可能想借助一些外物加大动作强度，但即使足不出户你也可以找到这样的物体。<br><br>
你需要的是可以让你抓住、能让你吊在空中的东西，随便看看就能找到它们――门、管道，甚至是树权。你根本不需要去健身房，即使在家中锻炼你需要的空间也不会很大――只要有
一块与你的身体同样大小（有时甚至更小）的地方就足够了。<br><br>
其他力量训练体系需要用金属重物、绳索、链条或某些器械给你施加阻力，与之不同的
是绝大多数体操动作利用的都是你最唾手可得的阻力――你自己的体重。无需在健身房、无
需借助健身器械，意味着你就不用准备很多东西，这样你的家中也不会凌乱不堪。此外，这
也意味着你可以随时随地锻炼――不管是度假时、出差时还是上班时，而且不用限定地点。<br><br>
这就是体操在监狱中幸存下来并大放异彩的原因――在那里，健身器械少之又少，而囚徒又
不能自主选择住所，有时甚至还要被单独禁闭。<br><br>
还有一大好处，就是体操锻炼不需要花钱。无需器械就意味着无需投资，无需健身房就
意味着不用交会员费――永远不用。<br><br>
2、用自身体重锻炼增强的是实用的运动能力<br><br>
体操以实用为最终目的，这是体操受到囚徒青睐的另一个原因。在监狱里，当你麻烦临
头时，你要有能力化险为夷。“绣花枕头”在夜总会或许还有些用，但在监狱里你需要有独
自解决问题的真正能力。<br><br>
其实锻炼时我们并不需要移动杠铃或哑铃。在可以移动外物之前，你首先得移动自己的
身体。人的双腿一定要有力，这样一来，在进行跑步和角斗等竞技运动时，你才能轻而易举
地承受躯干的重量。另外，你的背部与手臂也要有力，这样你才能自如地控制自己的身体。<br><br>
可惜的是，许多现代健身者不明白这些。他们锻炼的头等目标就是能移动外物。他们可
能精于此道，可他们忽略了移动自己的身体这一最基本的目标。我见过一些“庞然大物”，
他们能深蹲230 千克的重量，可上楼梯时却摇摆踌姗，像上了年纪的人一样上气不接下气。<br><br>
我认识一位身体发展失衡的举重运动员，他能卧推180 千克，却几乎无法自己梳头。
练习体操不会出现这些问题，因为体操本质上是“在运动中训练”“老派，休操会让你
成为绝顶强者，而且不管你练到什么程度，在运动时都只会更灵敏、更柔韧，而不是更迟钝、
更僵硬，因为你练出肌肉的目的是让它们移动你的身体，而不是移动外物。<br><br>
3、用自身体重锻炼会让你力大无穷<br><br>
体操是最有效的锻炼方式，因为体操正是人类的身体进化得适合做的事情，它们不仅仅
调用个别肌肉，而是会调用整个身体。也就是说，体操不仅能打造肌肉，还能锻炼肌腱、关
节和神经系统。<br><br>
在动作中肌肉和神经系统的协同作用是体操可以打造惊人力量的原因。受健美哲学的影
响，许多重量练习者都相信有棱有角的肌肉才是力量的源泉。但事实上，是神经系统使肌肉
细胞“开火”的，所以一个人的力量与爆发力主要由神经系统决定。这就解释了为什么会有
这种奇怪的现象：一个人可以比另一个人的块头小很多，但实际的力量比对方大很多。<br><br>
那些非常强壮的人都会告诉你，肌腱的力量很可能比肌肉块头更重要。体操动作能够以
自然的方式锻炼关节和肌腱，并使之达到一个很高的水平――比通过力量训练达到的水平更
高。<br><br>
体操能有效地增强我们身体力量的另一个原因就是，体操动作可以训练许多肌肉群一同
发力。例如，深蹲就不仅会锻炼大腿前侧的股四头肌，还能锻炼到臀大肌与臀小肌、脊柱、
髋部、腹部和腰部，甚至连脚趾肌肉也需要参与其中；而姿势标准的桥甚至会牵动我们全身
的百余块肌肉。<br><br>
这一点与前面所述的第二点相互呼应。人体自然地进化为以复合、整体的方式工作，而
很多健美动作，尤其是使用器械的动作，会人为地把肌肉孤立起来，致使肌肉的发展不协调，
功能不平衡。在做健美动作和重量训练时，动作经常被限定在特定的轨道里，这意味着只有
很少一部分区域得到了锻炼（有时甚至只能锻炼单一的肌肉群）。但是在体操训练中，你必
须移动整个身体，这就要求协调、平衡，甚至还要求精神的集中。所有这些都在增强肌肉力量的同时发展了“神经力量”。<br><br>
4、用自身体重锻炼能保护关节并使之更强壮<br><br>
在监狱里，不管你的年龄有多大，你的身体必须强壮。身体虚弱或关节疼痛很容易使你
受到他人的攻击，即使你的块头看上去很大也无济于事。你可能会觉得很奇怪，但这就是为
什么很多囚徒有意不进行重量训练的重要原因之一。<br><br>
现代的力量训练与阻力训练存在的一个主要问题就是会损伤关节。人体的关节由肌腔、
筋膜、韧带、滑囊这些纤弱的组织支撑着，这些组织都无法承受高强度、大重量训练的冲击。<br><br>
人体的有些部位很脆弱，如手腕、肘部、膝盖、下背部、髋部、脊柱、颈部等。大运动量训
练尤其容易使肩部受伤。如果你能找出一位已经练习一两年举重运动，而以上部位又没有慢
性关节疼痛的人，那你可是相当幸运。<br><br>
你可以先别轻信我的话。随便走进一家健身房你就会发现，举重练习者都会用高科技材
料制成的带子把腕部和膝盖裹起来、把腰部缠紧，同时还会在肘部使用固定绷带。健身房的
更衣室里经常散发着薄荷油和镇痛药的味道，这些都是用来减轻疼痛的。关节问题会与健美
者如影随形，而他们滥用类固醇则会使这些问题雪上加霜。然而，肌肉却会以不可思议的速
度增大，快得令关节望尘莫及。大多数健美者在将近40 岁时，身体的损伤已无法逆转，无
论他是否还在锻炼，疼痛已然成为其日常生活的一部分。<br><br>
受伤的原因在于健美动作大都很不自然。为了着重打造肌肉，那些健美者不得不在做动
作时以极不自然的动作角度举起极大的重量。这样做的副作用之一就是给脆弱的关节造成了
巨大的压力，而关节必须反复忍受这些恐怖的压力。久而久之，纤弱的组织被撕裂，随之而
来的还有肌腱炎、关节炎及其他疾病。关节发炎会出现红肿、瘫痕组织，甚至是钙化，这样
一来关节就会变得更脆弱、更僵硬。健美的主要目标在塑造肌肉，而肌肉能够比关节更快地
适应大重量的刺激。这就意味着，健美者的肌肉越发达，随之而来的病痛问题也就越严重。<br><br>
循序渐进地按照本书介绍的内容训练，则不会出现关节问题。相反，你的关节在会在不
断的运动中得到增强。如果你的关节有旧伤，甚至会慢慢好起来。为什么这些体操动作会对
关节有好处呢？有两个原因：从物理学角度来看，做体操动作所承受的阻力不会大于练习者
自身的重量，这样健美界推崇的过度负重训练的情况就不会出现了。从人体运动学角度来看，
人体经过数百万年进化的首要目的是能够使自己的身体灵活移动，而不是日复一日地以同样
的姿势举起越来越重的外物。<br><br>
运动学家可能会说，体操动作比举重技巧更“本真”。当你移动自己的身体时，比如做
引体向上或深蹲时，你的肌肉和骨骼会自发地调整为最有效、最自然的运动方式。相反，举
重时你的身体不得不尽可能不自然地移动，从而最大限度地锻炼相应部位的肌肉。引体向上
能很好地体现体操“本真”的性质。我们的灵长类远亲要借助树枝让自己在树丛中悠来荡去，
即使人类已经进化至今，但遗传下来的身体结构在人体内依然存在，这就是为什么大家能快
速而安全地进行引体向上训练的原因。健美者用俯身划船替代引体向上，但人类的身体并没
有进化得适合这样做，所以许多举重者做这个动作很容易伤到脊柱、下背部以及肩部。<br><br>
体操动作会自然地利用关节，从而使关节与肌肉协调发展。久而久之，你的关节就会更
加强劲有力，而不会饱受折磨、越来越弱。随着你的关节组织逐步修复，原来的老伤旧痛会
一扫而去，以后你也就不会轻易受伤了。<br><br>

5、用自身体重锻炼能快速打造完美体形<br><br>
力量与健康应该是健身的主要目标。而体操既可以让你的身体尽可能强劲有力，又可以
让你的肌肉和关节健康且实用。<br><br>
但说老实话，大家都想练出点块头来，而且越大越好。因为这既可以增强自信，也能够
向其他男人发出这样一种信息――“别惹我”（当然，在与女士相处时不会有什么妨碍），这
是监狱文化的重要部分。<br><br>
现代体操主要是为了增强耐力和有氧能力，但无法发展出极限力量。“老派”体操则会
以最直接、最有效的方式给你的骨架裹上大块肌肉，并让你的体能达到巅峰。另外，
“老派”体操也不会让你像那些使用类固醇的现代健美人士那样，看上去就像穿着鼓鼓囊
囊的畸形的猩猩装，而会让你自然、健康、拥有比例完美的身材，就像那些为古希腊神像做
模特的运动员一样。即便在今天，那些运动员依然被视为完美身材的典范。<br><br>
在使用类固醇之前的时代，人们普遍认为有史以来肌肉最发达、最符合审美标准的人是
约翰。格里迈克（John Grimek）。1939 年，他被评为“完美男人”，并两次获得“美国先生”
的称号（1940 年、1941 年）――他是历史上准一一位两次获得此称号的人。他的体格令人
望而生畏，直到现在这样认为的人还大有人在。格里迈克简直是男子气概的终极范本。不同
于今天那些肌肉僵硬的健美人士，格里迈克还是一名能力非凡的运动员。摆造型时，他会先
做个倒立撑，然后再把腿放下来做一个完美的桥，接下来会把腿伸直劈叉坐下。格里迈克是狂热的举重运动员，但他也说自己是主要通过倒立练习锻炼上肢肌肉的。他宣讲体操的价值，
但听众似乎寥寥无几。<br><br>
下次电视上播放男子体操时你不妨看看，他们就是用自身体重锻炼出魁梧健壮的体格
的。那些家伙都有强健的二头肌，他们的肩部就像个椰子，背阔肌则像一对翅膀，所有这些
都只是靠克服重力移动自己身体获得的。过去的人们都是这样锻炼的。<br><br>
6、用自身体重锻炼可以保持正常体脂率<br><br>
其实，健美运动会让你暴饮暴食。忘记你在杂志里看到的那些大块头吧，他们在大部分
时间里都没办法保持那样的身材。只有在近乎变态地控制饮食数月之后，他们才能在短暂的
赛季内拍出那样的照片。在赛季外的其他时间，他们的体重会猛增―会长二三十千克甚至更
多的赘肉。而这还是所谓的专业人士，普通健美者的情况则更糟，他们读到的杂志都告诉他
们要摄人比实际所需多得多的蛋白质（其实是为了推销营养补剂）。结果，健美者们会寻找
各种机会吞下大量能促进肌肉生长的食品。然而，大多数人都不会使用大剂量的类固醇，而
正常的新陈代谢并不能把所有的额外热量转化成肌肉。其结果就是，认真进行重量训练的人
大都会营养过剩，脂肱堆积。<br><br>
重量训练与暴饮暴食紧密相连。专业的举重运动员都认为，如果在锻炼前吃得多一点儿，
举得就会好一点儿，肌肉就能多长一点儿。锻炼之后，他们吃得也自然多一点儿。<br><br>
体操锻炼中的情况则恰恰相反。如果说肥胖与健美运动是最好的朋友，那么肥胖与体操
就是天然的敌人。如果你的目标是用180 千克的重量做俯身杠铃划船，那你可以随意多吃，
因为即便你挺着大肚子，也依然可以达到目标。但是，如果你的目标是做单臂引体向上，那
你就不能不顾及体重，毕竟还没有人能在变成大胖子之后反而更加擅长做类似的体操动作。<br><br>
体操的目标就是学会移动自己的身体，你越胖这对你而言就越难。一旦你开始有规律地
进行体操训练，你的潜意识就会将体重与训练难度联系起来，并且会自动调节食欲与饮食结
构。我的亲身经历使我对此深信不疑。进行体操训练的人会自然地失去赘肉，试试看吧！<br><br>
熄灯！<br><br>
本书的读者会有许多不同类型：有些是想增加些力量和肌肉的健身爱好者；而有很多可
能已经是资深健美人士、重量训练者或健身房的会员了，这些人可能只是随便翻翻与健身有
关的书籍，以便学点儿额外的技巧和方法，将其用在自己的训练中―也许只是在度假或离开
健身房回家的路上读一读；还有一些可能是对健身感兴趣的热心人士，想知道我们在监狱里
是如何锻炼的。<br><br>
不管你属于哪一类，我都希望本书能让你了解用自身体重锻炼的价值。我对传播这一方
法充满激情，因为我知道所有人都能从这种在监狱中幸存的方法中获益。对我而言，本书远
不止是一本关于健身技巧的书，它是变革现代力量训练的宣言――囚徒宣言。<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
囚徒健身<br><br>
我开始有写这本书的想法，是在安哥拉监狱时，也就是在我八年刑期的第六年。我已经
训练了很多家伙，并成功地使他们达到了巅峰。所以，我有一大捆零散的笔记，放在一个大
文件夹里。写书并不是我的主意，也不是我那些狱友们的主意，而是一位狱警提出来的，他
叫龙尼（Ronnie ）。<br><br>
龙尼是个黑人，他的块头很大，身体壮得像头牛，我和狱友们都很尊敬他，因为他在当
地是一位很有名的举重运动员。他看起来像卡车一样结实，事实上他也和卡车一样强壮有力。
尽管他说话轻声细语，但没人敢惹他。你绝对不想让他把你撂倒，因为在这一过程中，他几
乎能把你的胳膊拧下来。但我和他相处得很融洽，很大一部分原因是我们都对力量感兴趣。<br><br>
有时，他晚上巡视到我囚室外的时候会停下来，跟我聊聊这个或那个练习，或者是听我讲一
些“老派”体操的历史。有一天，我正和他说倒立训练的妙处时，他突然脱口而出：“你应
该把这些写下来，外头没人知道这些东西，都失传了。”我在不同监狱的图书馆看了不少关



于健身的杂志和书籍，出狱之后又看了一些。我不得不说，我非常同意龙尼的说法。
接下来的几年，我试着用文字把自己的训练技巧和方法记录下来。该训练体系已经存在，
所以把它写出来并不算难，更别说我还有多年训练他人的经验。不过，要将繁杂的知识进行
浓缩和提炼然后编成一本书，的确花费了我大量的精力。我以前几乎不怎么写作，不过欣慰
的是我还是利用空闲时间把这本书完成了。<br><br>
这本书便是我这些年努力的结果。为易于理解，我先在此概述一下本书的结构。这样读
者就会知道自己能读到哪些内容，以及如何最合理地使用本书。另外，我还想概括一下本书
的核心内容，尤其是“六艺”与“十式”。<br><br>
第一部分：预备<br><br>
第一部分是预备。这一部分将告诉你本书介绍的体系的大背景，包括四章内容：第
一章“力量之旅”；第二章“失传的技艺”；第三章“自身体重锻炼与现代健身方法”；
第四章“关于本书”。读完这四章之后，你应该对本书介绍的这套训练方法的性质、作
用和优势等问题有所了解。另外，你还会了解监狱训练的传统，以及“囚徒健身”的起
源和历史。这些章节不仅会帮助你了解我的健身体系，而且也有助于你排除由于“来源
不实”而对监狱训练或体操所持有的任何误解。<br><br>

本书第二部分“六艺”，我所介绍的健身体系的精华都在这部分之中。正如标题所示，
囚徒健身的基础是六大类不同的动作，即“六艺”。<br><br>
任何称职的健身教练都会告诉你，有成千上万种练习可以锻炼你的肌肉，但实际上真正
好的健身计划只需要一些基本动作。这是因为尽管人体有五百多块肌肉，但这些肌肉都是要
与其他肌肉共同工作的。尝试孤立地锻炼肌肉的人往往会忽略这一事实，并逐渐削弱身体作
为协调的整体来运作的自然本能。因此，锻炼肌肉最好的方式就是选择可以完全锻炼身体的
几个基本动作，在这些动作中不断变强。<br><br>
六艺<br><br>
我所介绍的健身体系包括能锻炼全身肌肉（从头到脚，绝无遗漏）的六类基本动作。这
六类动作基于几百年的传统，并建立在反复实验的基础上，吸取了成功的经验和失败的教训，
符合解剖学与人体运动学的基本原理。这六大类动作及其所锻炼的主要肌肉群都已在表1
中列出。快速浏览一下表1 你就可以发现，这六大类动作可以锻炼人体所有重要的肌肉群。<br><br>
这些动作可以完美地结合在一起：桥可以锻炼背部肌肉，举腿可以锻炼腹部肌肉，俯卧撑可
以锻炼上身的推力肌肉，引体向上可以锻炼拉力肌肉。不过，这些动作锻炼的肌肉也并非完
全不同。例如，俯卧撑除了锻炼上身的推力肌肉外，也能锻炼腹肌；桥除了锻炼背部肌肉外，
也能锻炼三角肌。这个表格仅仅告诉你每个动作锻炼的主要肌肉群。你可以从中看出，这六
个动作就足以锻炼全身，再多就过头了，再少则会有疏漏。<br><br>
十式<br><br>
一个动作反复做很多次没什么不好。但正如第二章所讲的，你在做俯卧撑或引体向上时，
若只是增加动作的次数，那么只能增强你的耐力，对增强你的身体力量和打造肌肉没什么效
果。而增强力量在任何一个监狱健身体系中都是最关键的，这也是我所介绍的健身体系的核
心。因此，我把六艺中的每一艺都细分为十个级别。<br><br>

这十级动作被称为十式。我之所以将其细分为十级，是为了能让健身者在健身过程中可
以循序渐进，逐步从新手级别过渡到大师级别。随着健身者能力的不断增强，其挑战的难度
也需不断提高。但这并不意味着每类动作的难度只有十级，其实每一式都可以在难度上进一
步细分，手脚的姿势、身体的角度、力臂的长短、借力的有无……都会让一种练习成为难度
无穷变化的一系列练习（详见每一式中的“稳扎稳打”部分）。切记：健身要循序渐进，不
要急于求成。<br><br>
在第二部分中，每一艺都单独成章，每一章又包含十式的全部细节。例如，第六章介绍
的动作都是深蹲的变式，难度逐级增加，第一式最容易，第十式最难。<br><br>

第一式肩倒立深蹲最容易，第十式单腿深蹲最难。几乎人人都能做肩倒立深蹲，即使他
的身体很弱。相反，几乎没人能够第一次就完成单腿深蹲，不管他多么健康、多么强壮。我
之所以构建这样的体系，就是为了让健身者做自己的教练，从而在没有器械辅助的情况下，
慢慢到达能够做上几十次单腿深蹲的级别。<br><br>
如果你掌握了第十式，那你的大腿将比健身房里可以负重180 千克做深蹲、肌肉僵硬的
鼠辈更强壮、更健康、更有力。单腿深蹲是一项令人吃惊的技艺，但是现在没多少人真正知
道究竟如何掌握它。他们会尝试着做单腿深蹲，但结果很可能是一次都没法完成。其实，只
要通过我介绍的十式逐步训练，你很快就能掌握这门技艺―你既能拥有健康的身体，又能获
得心理上的满足。<br><br>
十式是我的健身体系中最重要、最具革新价值的内容。合理应用这些知识，你的身体就
可以在短时期内从柔弱变得强健，我在狱中教过的那些人对此体系可谓视若珍宝。要知道，知识就是力量。关于我的健身体系的相关知识之前从未跨出过监狱的大门，更不曾公之于众，
你手中的这本书标志着有关十式的全部细节第一次呈现在大众眼前。<br><br>
最终式<br><br>
我的目标就是让你可以完成每艺中最难的那一式，即第十式。第十式是每类动作的极限，
所以有时我也将其称为“最终式”。六艺的每一艺都只有一个第十式，所以共有六个最终式
练习，你应该花时间攻克这些动作，让自己的技能日臻完美。这六个“终极”自身体重练习
如表3 所示。<br><br>
很少有人能以完美的姿势把这六个最终式都做上数次。有少数人可以做其中的一两个动
作，因为很多家伙都只集中锻炼身体的某几个部位，极少有人想把全身都练得很强壮，这是
人们犯的最主要的错误。正因如此，你会发现虽然有个别人能做单臂俯卧撑，但几乎没有人


（除去在最难熬的监狱或精英体操训练营中待过的人）能规范地将这六个最终式都做到。只
有很少一部分精英能正确掌握这六个最终式的技巧，你一定要下决心，让自己跻身其中。<br><br>
升级表<br><br>
第二部分的每一章都列有一个清晰简明的升级表（附在十式解说之后），以帮助你训练。<br><br>
这六张表按顺序列出了十式，以及每一式的升级条件，即何时可以确定自己已经掌握了这一
式，可以开始练习下一式了。健身者一定要遵循建议，这很重要，急于求成会产生不良的后
果：技巧糟糕、受伤、最后失去健身的动力。<br><br>
变式<br><br>
第二部分的每一章都以“变式”部分收尾。六艺有许许多多不同的变式，并不是所有变
式都囊括在十式中。这一方面是因为不是所有变式都适合放在升级系列中，另一方面是因为
没必要将某一动作的所有变式都囊括在一个计划中。<br><br>
举几个例子。屈臂撑锻炼的肌肉与俯卧撑类似，因此我将其归为俯卧撑的变式。以前，
倒立臂屈伸与倒立撑是相关联的练习动作，因此我将其归为倒立撑的变式。深蹲跳与跳箱子
都属于爆发力式深蹲，因而我将其归为深蹲的变式。<br><br>
这些变式并不能代替十式。不过，知道一些变式还是很有必要的。如果你想在自己健身
计划中加点儿变化或想在受伤时继续锻炼，就会用到这些动作。<br><br>

本章概述了本书的全部内容。这很重要，因为本书并不仅仅是一本包含许多技巧与理念
的训练手册。它是一套完整的体系，一种哲学，一种生活方式；它是我和狱友们几十年来赖
以生存的基础，它使我在狱中能够免于陷人混乱，有时它就是决定生死的最后一线希望。<br><br>
这本书是我在狱中总结的健身知识的精华。我在狱中学来，在此将其与你分享，这样你
就不必再去狱中学习了。我写这本书是为了使这套训练方法可以为大众所用。记住，别只是
读，要用！在开始锻炼之前，你先要明白这套体系的益处―详细阅读第三章的内容。确定你
已经明白之后，你就可以阅读接下来的内容了――学习六艺中正确的动作技巧以及需要避免
的错误。<br><br>
现在就开始吧！你不需要任何特殊的器械，先从俯卧撑、深蹲、举腿等动作的第一式开
始。只要你的身体没有伤病或者残疾，这些动作对你来说都非常容易。首先，你要阅读我列
出的升级表，等你读完整本书之后，你就可以运用第十二章的内容自己制订健身计划了。<br><br>
从你决定按照本书的体系开始健身的那一刻起――也就是今天，你的终极目标必须是完
美地做到六个最终式。记住，不仅仅是做到一两个动作的最终式，而要一个不落！<br><br>
这一点太重要了，所以我必须重申一遍：<br><br>
你的终极目标必须是完美地做到六个最终式。<br><br>
我不关心你的身材怎样，年龄多大。你可能进步得很快，也可能要花上几年时间才能达
到巅峰，但这都无所谓―除了努力与勇气，其他都无所谓。你所需要的健身知识在本书中应
有尽有，你有能力做到。不要跟我讲任何借口，在外面，脆弱的情感和身体兴许还算是挺光
荣的事情，但在监狱里，只会招致欺辱。对我的学生而言，欺辱是不可接受的。<br><br>
灯熄了。你独处在你的囚室之中，一无所有，只有自己的身体与心灵相伴。<br><br>
开始练吧。<br><br>

第二部分：六艺<br><br>
这一部分主要讲解了囚徒健身的六艺。第五~十章详细介绍了相关动作的练习方法。关
于这些动作的只是主要包括：<br><br>

	<b><a name="T10">第五章 俯卧撑</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
俯卧撑是最好的上身练习动作，它既可以增强我们的身体力量、打造出结实的肌肉、形
成强有力的肌腔，又可以让上身的推力肌肉与腹部、下背部及下身协调工作。世上其他的练
习动作起不到所有这些作用。卧推被吹捧为顶级的上身练习动作，其实这是错误的。因为卧
推不仅人为地将上身孤立，还会（即便是进行短期练习）损伤肩袖，对肘关节和腕关节也有
不利影响。俯卧撑不但会保护这些关节，还能发展出能用的力量――在现实世界中（而不仅



仅在健身房中）真正有用的力量。这就是为什么俯卧撑在全世界的巅和军事训练营都是肌肉
训练的首选――自从历史上第一位战士开始力量训练时，它就一直如此。<br><br>
可是，卧推成了大众的宠儿，俯卧撑却沦为多次数的耐力练习，这是我们的耻辱。其实，
如果你知道如何循序渐进地练习俯卧撑，你就能拥有令人惊讶的上身力量――足以与任何一
位健美者或举重运动员媲美，甚至还会胜出。你的双肩会感谢你的！本章节将告诉你与俯卧
撑相关的全部知识，足够让你成为这一技艺的终极大师。<br><br>
俯卧撑的益处<br><br>
不同形式的俯卧撑锻炼肌肉的程度不同，但俯卧撑的所有变式都能增强力量、打肌肉。
俯卧撑尤其锻炼胸大肌、三角肌前束和胸小肌，从而最大限度地发展你躯干上的推力肌肉。
此外，俯卧撑还能够锻炼肱三头肌（上臂的主要肌肉）的三个头。<br><br>
俯卧撑不但能够通过最理想的动作幅度来锻炼以上这些重要肌肉，甚至可以使其他部位
的肌肉也得到很好的静力锻炼―在动作中，有些肌肉不得不静止地收缩以保持身体稳定。得
到静力锻炼的肌肉包括背阔肌、胸腔中所有的深层肌肉、脊椎肌肉、腹肌、腰部与髋部的肌
肉、臀肌、股四头肌、胫骨前肌，甚至连你的双脚与脚趾也会受益。<br><br>
以正确的方式循序渐进地练习俯卧撑还可以锻炼关节与肌腱，增强身体的整体力量，改
善健康状况。支撑手指、腕部、前臂及肘部的那些微小却至关重要的深层肌肉与组织，也会
在练习俯卧撑的过程中变得越来越强。另外，腕管综合征、网球肘、高尔夫球肘以及普通疼
痛出现的概率也会大大减少。有些俯卧撑的变式（如偏重俯卧撑，参见第52 一53 页）需要
借助不稳定的支撑物，这可以使极易受伤、会给许多力量训练者带来无尽伤痛的肩袖变得“刀
枪不人”。俯卧撑训练还可以促进血液循环，从而清除关节内累积的废物、消除关节粘连、
使瘫痕组织得以修复。重量训练者若在日程中加人循序渐进的俯卧撑训练，将使一些重要关
节更不易受伤（相对于那些单单练习举重的人）。<br><br>
完美技巧=完美结果<br><br>
我可能读过几百页关于“正确”的俯卧撑技巧的东西，从武术书到老的军事手册，那些
资料中的描述往往各不相同。其实，每个人眼中的“完美”技巧都会略有不同。这完全可以
归因为身体类型的不同―四肢的长短、不同部位力量的相对大小、身体中的脂肱比例等方面
的差别。另外，伤病史也会对其产生一定的影响。因此，与其写一些教科书式的完美俯卧撑
条例，不如与大家分享几条一般原则：<br><br>
・避免诡异的角度和手部姿势。找到适合自己的锻炼姿势。<br><br>
・躯干、髋部、双腿始终要成一条直线。只有那些腰部力量太弱无法锁定躯干的人，才
会出现做俯卧撑时撅屁股的情况。<br><br>
・双腿始终要并拢。如果双腿分开，做动作时就无需保持躯干稳定，练习就变容易了。
・在动作最高点时，双臂要伸直，但不要让肘部完全锁定，而要使其微弯，以免关节不
舒服。（有时这被描述为让手臂保持“柔软”。）<br><br>
・要平缓地呼吸。根据我的经验：上推时应呼气，下降时应吸气。但如果你感觉呼吸费
力，就不要遵循这一原则，而要多呼吸几次。<br><br>
速度<br><br>
许多家伙都建议做俯卧撑时速度要快，甚至是越快越好。有些人甚至喜欢做“弹震式”
俯卧撑，其实这只不过是给老式“击掌”俯卧撑起的花哨的现代名字―用爆发力把身体推起，
推起的高度要足以在空中击掌一次、两次，甚至三次。<br><br>
快速地做俯卧撑的确有一定的好处。快速动作通过一种叫作“牵张反射”的机制刺激并

锻炼神经系统。许多俯卧撑比赛都有时间限制，选手做得越快，就越有可能胜出。此外，你
还可以了解自己能让肌肉多么快速地动起来。所以，如果你做俯卧撑的水平已经超过人门级
别、你的关节和肌肉已经具备一定的条件，那你的确应该偶尔做一些速度更快的俯卧撑。不
过，不管你的水平多高，你都要分期逐渐增加速度，好让身体适应。<br><br>
每隔几周变换花样做几组快速练习，对运动能力有好处。尽管如此，最主要的俯卧撑练
习还是应该做得慢一些，经2 秒降到最低点，坚持1 秒，再用2 秒回到最高点，之后立即降
低身体。<br><br>
为什么应该以这样的速度做俯卧撑呢？原因有二：第一，平缓的动作能够练就更高水平
的纯粹力量。当你做爆发式运动时，这一动作的某些部分不可避免地要依赖惯性，惯性发挥
作用就意味着你的肌肉没有发挥作用。这样，当你快速练习某个动作时，你其实是在作弊。
我们总会看到有人做俯卧撑时会从最低点“弹”起来，因为他们的肌肉缺乏能移动身体的纯
粹力量。<br><br>
第二，与爆发式运动相比，人类的关节更适应常规运动。如果你进行的是常规运动，那
你受到慢性或急性损伤的可能性就很小。只有当你的关节已经适应了一般的、速度平缓的动
作之后，快速动作对你而言才是安全的。如果你喜欢，那么爆发式动作可以作为你训练时的
补充，但它不应该成为主要训练方式。只做爆发式动作的人早晚会关节疼痛、咔咔作响。<br><br>
篮球、棒球，亲亲宝贝
我下面描述的一些俯卧撑动作需要借助一些外物，这是为了增强练习效果。借助外物控
制动作幅度虽然不是必须的，但是非常有用，尤其是当你独自锻炼时。这也是在监狱中广泛
使用的一种健身技巧。<br><br>

你只需要篮球和棒球，这些“器械”几乎在任何一家商店都可以买到。过去的人常常用
很重的健身球，而不用篮球。其实，篮球不仅价格便宜，而且效果也不错。如果你不想用篮
球或棒球，那你可以用一个与其大小相当的物体代替。砖块是一个不错的选择，将三块砖垒
起来就相当于一个篮球的高度，一块平放在地上的砖则几乎和棒球一样高。不管使用什么物
体，要确保其足够安全，不会伤到你。切记，不要选用任何易碎或边缘呈锯齿状的物体。<br><br>
当你使用物体控制俯卧撑的动作幅度时，有一点很重要，那就是不要与此物体发生碰撞。<br><br>
你应该轻缓地下降，直到轻轻地接触篮球、棒球或是你选用的其他物体。那么，你究竟应该
以多大的力接触这些物体呢？监狱里将其形容为“亲亲宝贝”。例如，你的胸上部要在动作
进行到最低点时接触棒球，你接触棒球的力度就是你亲孩子额头时的力度―不能太大，也不
要太小。<br><br>
在动作进行到最低点后暂停片刻，可以消除任何惯性，并增强肌肉力量与控制力。这就
是为什么我提倡在动作进行到最低点时保持1 秒的原因。另外，“亲亲宝贝”这一技巧也可

以应用到重量训练中，如卧推或肩部推举。如果你不能在动作进行到最低点时让横杆轻轻地
“亲吻”你的身体，而是不得不弹回来或突然停止，这就说明杠铃的重量过重了。怎样就算
过重了呢？简言之，如果你不能在某一动作幅度内完全控制这一重量，那它就过重了。<br><br>
手掌、拳头、手腕还是手指？<br><br>
我建议健身者在做大多数俯卧撑变式时，都将手掌平放在地板上。许多健身者都因能够
以独特的手部姿势做俯卧撑而得意―他们使用拳头、手指、大拇指，甚至是腕部的背面作支
撑。我要求我所有的学生一生都练习俯卧撑―采用对他们的关节而言最舒服的手部姿势。对
大多数人来说，最舒服的姿势就是手掌平放在地板上这个经典姿势。当然，腕部有伤的人例
外，对他们而言，腕部锁定，以拳头着地做俯卧撑最容易。<br><br>
指尖俯卧撑能够锻炼双手、前臂的力量，对你的健身计划而言是很有用的补充，尤其是
当你正在进行大量抓握训练时。做指尖俯卧撑得循序渐进，从第一式―墙壁俯卧撑（参见第
40 一41 页）做起，然后逐步用指尖代替手掌，等完全适应之后再开始下一式，就这样一点
点地进步。对大多数人来说，每周或每两周练习几组经典的指尖俯卧撑（双手完全张开），
就足以让自己的双手比普通人更强壮、更结实。这样对你来说就已经足够了。<br><br>
即使这样还不能满足你的胃口，也不要轻易尝试用更少的手指做这个动作。最保险的方
法是，使用十根手指练俯卧撑系列，直到你能做单臂指尖俯卧撑为止―很少有人能达到这个
高级阶段。相信我，当你能以五根手指为支撑做指尖俯卧撑时，你的手指将如钢条一般坚硬。
以掌背或腕关节为支点做俯卧撑绝对是种折磨，而且会影响肌肉发力―在肌肉还未使出
全力之前，你的腕部已经无力支撑身体了。如果你不是一流的空手道高手，完全不需要为了
攻击而强化这些部位―我甚至根本都不会尝试一下。<br><br>
俯卧撑系列<br><br>
大多数俯卧撑锻炼体系包含的变式都很少。通常情况下，专业的健身人士给健身者的唯
一建议就是增加动作的次数或者随着练习变得越来越容易时把双脚架在某些物体之上―越
来越高。这是错误的，大错特错！一旦健身者已经适应了某个动作，这样做只能增加耐力。<br><br>
在所有力量训练中，升级都是最重要的。就肌肉的大小与爆发力来说，如果你所做的动
作一成不变，那你的收获也一成不变―不管你反复练习了多少次都没有意义。本书介绍的体
系包括十个不同的俯卧撑动作，我将其称为十式，每一式都比前一式的难度更大。对大多数
人来说，六艺的前三式都相对容易，伤病正在恢复的训练者可以将其当作有治疗效果的系列
练习。同时前三式也能帮助初学者或超重者轻松上手，并逐步提高他们的体能。剩下的几式
则越来越难，直到最难的变式―最终式。我建议健身者一步步练习―从初级到中级，再到高
级―按照我所给出的练习次数一式一式地逐渐升级。<br><br>
你可以对每个动作进行细微的调整，使其更加适合自己。具体操作方法可以在“稳扎稳
打”部分找到。进行微调之后，一个动作就相当于变成了几个动作。因此俯卧撑系列不仅包
括十式，还包括上百种不同的变式。在以图文对照的形式对十式进行详细讲解之后，我还在
本章的最后列出了两页升级表。如果你还想了解更多，可以阅读本章的最后一部分――变式
（见第63~67 页），这部分包括十几种俯卧撑的其他变式或替代动作的描述。<br><br>
以下是俯卧撑十式的详细说明（见第40~59 页）。<br><br>

动作<br><br>
面对墙壁站立，双脚并拢，双臂伸直，与肩同宽，双手平放在墙上，手掌与胸等高。这
是该动作的起始姿势（图1）。弯曲肘部，直到前额轻触墙面。这是该动作的结束姿势（图2）。<br><br>
然后将自己推回到起始姿势，如此重复。<br><br>
解析<br><br>
俯卧撑动作共有十式，墙壁俯卧撑只是第一式。既然是第一式，也就最容易的，毫无疑
问普通人都能做。墙壁俯卧撑也是第一个有治疗效果的练习。刚受伤、做过手术或身体正处
于恢复期的人若想加快恢复速度、尽快拥有强健的体魄，可以选择这个动作。肘、腕、肩（尤
其是柔弱的肩袖）极易出现慢性或急性损伤，这项练习能够轻柔地刺激这些部位，并改善血
液循环。不熟悉徒手体操的初学者应该以较轻柔的动作开始训练，然后逐步提高自己的运动
技巧，循序渐进地增强自己的运动能力。我建议就从这个练习动作开始。<br><br>
训练目标<br><br>
・初级标准：1 组，10 次<br><br>

・升级标准：3 组，各50 次<br><br>
稳扎稳打<br><br>
只要身体没有残疾、没有严重的伤病或疾病，一般人应该都能完成这个动作。如果你刚
好处于伤病或手术的恢复期，那么这个动作就是很好的“测试”，能让你了解自己的身体在

	<b><a name="T12">第二式 上斜俯卧撑</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
动作<br><br>
做这个动作需要借助一个稳固的物体，高度大约是你身高的一半（大概到臀部位置）。
桌子、高一些的椅子、工作台、厨房操作台、矮墙、结实的栅栏都是不错的选择。大多数监
狱牢房里的洗漱台高度就正好，不过你得保证它足够结实。双脚并拢，身体成一条直线，然
后前倾上身，双臂伸直，双手抓住所选物体，与肩同宽。这是该动作的起始姿势（图3）。<br><br>
弯曲肘部，放低身体，直到胸部轻触物体顶部。如果你选择的物体高度合适，那么此时你的
身体与地面的夹角约为450（图4）。暂停一会，然后将自己推回到起始姿势，如此重复。<br><br>
解析<br><br>
这个动作的难度比第一式（墙壁俯卧撑）高，因为你将自己推回到起始姿势时，身体与
地面的夹角更小，这意味着你的上肢肌肉要承受更大的重量。上斜俯卧撑比标准俯卧撑（第
五式）容易，对大多数人来说，这个动作对肌肉的要求并不太高，而且它能帮助初学者平稳
进步，对康复期的健身者也非常有帮助。<br><br>
训练目标<br><br>
・初级标准：1 组，10 次<br><br>
・中级标准：2 组，各20 次<br><br>
・升级标准：3 组，各40 次<br><br>
稳扎稳打<br><br>
到达动作的最低点时，你的身体与地面的夹角约为45°。初学者如果达不到这么高的
水平，那就降低难度（加大倾斜角度，也就是让身体更接近直立）――只要选择高度高于你
身体中间点的物体即可。然后，再逐渐减小角度，直到可以轻而易举地完成倾斜45°的上
斜俯卧撑。如果你还想尝试更小的角度，可以利用台阶做此动作――随着能力的提高，你可
以逐渐降低支撑物的高度。<br><br>

动作<br><br>
双脚并拢，双膝着地。双臂伸直，与肩同宽。双手在胸部的正下方，两个手掌平放在地
面上。脚踝搭在一起，大腿与上身及头部成一条直线，不要撅屁股或者塌腰。这是该动作的
起始姿势（图5）。然后以膝盖为支点，弯曲肘部，直到胸部与地面仅一拳之隔（图6）。暂
停一下，然后将自己推回到起始姿势，如此重复。<br><br>
解析<br><br>
膝盖俯卧撑是俯卧撑系列的第三式，是初学者要掌握的重要动作。它是在地面上做的俯
卧撑中最容易的一个，起着承前启后的作用―此前的俯卧撑都是站立完成的，后面的俯卧撑
全是地面动作，而且难度更高。女士们经常会做膝盖俯卧撑，因为她们的上肢力量相对较弱，
不易完成标准俯卧撑，不过这个动作对男士也大有好处。对那些超重或身材走形的人来说，
膝盖俯卧撑是不错的起点。因为采用这样的姿势推起上半身相对容易，所以在开始做更难的
俯卧撑之前，膝盖俯卧撑是绝佳的热身练习。<br><br>

・中级标准：2 组，各15 次<br><br>
・升级标准：3 组，各30 次<br><br>
稳扎稳打<br><br>
如果你不能完成标准的膝盖俯卧撑，可以减小动作幅度―不要降低到离地面一拳的距
离，而是把动作幅度缩短到你能舒服地完成的程度，同时增加次数（约20 次）。你要不断练
习（保持高反复次数），逐渐增加动作深度，直至可以完成标准的膝盖俯卧撑。<br><br>

双脚并拢，锁紧身体，使上身、髋部和双腿成一条直线。先伸直手臂，然后降低身体到大约
一半臂长的高度，或者直到肘部弯成直角。控制下降高度的绝佳方式就是使用篮球或橄榄球
――将球放在髋部下方。这是该动作的起始姿势（图7）。接下来，弯曲肘部，直到髋部与
球轻轻接触（图8）。对大多数人来说，这样可以方便且客观地标示这个动作的最低点。暂
停一下，然后用力将自己推回到起始姿势。<br><br>
解析<br><br>
半俯卧撑非常重要，要熟练掌握。很多人做俯卧撑的方法都不正确―撅屁股或者塌腰，
这是因为他们的腰部肌肉和脊椎肌肉不发达。这个动作可以锻炼你的腰部肌肉和脊椎肌肉，
从而能够锁定a 部，使身体成一条直线。<br><br>

・中级标准：2 组，各12 次<br><br>
・升级标准：2 组.各25 次<br><br>
稳扎稳打<br><br>
如果你做不了半俯卧撑，可以减小动作幅度。如果你选用的是篮球，那就将其放在膝盖
下，而不是髋部下方。伸直手臂，然后慢慢降低身体，直到膝盖与球接触，这相当于四分之
一俯卧撑。如果你能做10 次以上四分之一俯卧撑，那就可以把篮球向上移一点儿，就这样
逐步移动篮球，直到其位于髋部下方为止。<br><br>

动作<br><br>
窄距俯卧撑的起始姿势与标准俯卧撑基本相同（见第五式），只不过需要双手相触――
无需重叠，也不需要让双手的拇指与食指构成一个“钻石”，只要两个食指指尖相触就可以
了。从手臂伸直的起始姿势开始（图11），慢慢放低身体，直到胸部轻触手背（图12）。暂
停一下，然后将自己推回到起始姿势。<br><br>
解析<br><br>
窄距俯卧撑很古老，它在俯卧撑十式中至关重要，但人们通常更喜欢弹震式俯卧撑或下
斜俯卧撑这些花哨的动作，而忽略窄距俯卧撑。这简直是悲剧，因为窄距俯卧撑在攻克单臂
俯卧撑之旅中必不可少。大多数人做单臂俯卧撑都会感到吃力，他们会发现很难在身体降到
最低点之后再把自己推起来。这是因为此时肘部的弯曲程度最大，而肘部的弯曲角度超过直
角时胳膊就很难使上力气。做窄距俯卧撑时，由于双手的特殊位置，当你的身体降到最低点
时，肘部的弯曲度比做标准俯卧撑时的更大。这个动作可以锻炼三头肌，并且强化你的肘部
与腕部的肌腱。因此，能舒服地做窄距俯卧撑的人在终于要挑战单臂俯卧撑的时候，会更从

解析<br><br>
单臂半俯卧撑是俯卧撑系列的第八式。通过这个练习，训练者可以逐步从双侧练习转为
单侧练习。该动作可以提高你的平衡能力，而这对做单臂俯卧撑极其重要。因为只靠单臂发
力，所以这个动作也会让手部、腕部和肩部关节为之后的动作做好准备。单臂半俯卧撑在这
个系列中不可或缺，你必须掌握。不过由于肘关节只是部分弯曲，所以对一次完整的俯卧撑

解析<br><br>
标准杠杆俯卧撑的难度与单臂俯卧撑相差无几，这也正是杠杆俯卧撑在俯卧撑十式中排
在第九的原因。你会发现，撑在篮球上的那只手臂几乎帮不上什么忙，这就迫使支撑身体的

由于杠杆原理，撑在篮球上的那只手臂如果完全伸直的话就很难用力。你可以让这只手
臂的肘部稍稍弯曲，从而让篮球离你的身体近一点儿，这样做杠杆俯卧撑会容易一些。不过
不要太过，要是你把篮球放在身体正下方，那这个动作就变成了第七式―偏重俯卧撑。随着
你越来越强壮，你可以逐渐让球远离身体，直到可以将手臂伸直做标准的杠杆俯卧撑。

	<b><a name="T20">最终式 单臂俯卧撑</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
动作<br><br>
跪在地板上，一只手撑在你前方的地面上。双腿向后蹬直，用脚趾支撑身体。脊柱与髋
部成一条直线，支撑身体的手臂在胸部下方伸直――不要在身体侧面或是靠前的位置。稳定
之后，把不起支撑作用的那只手背在身后。这是该动作的起始姿势（图19）。弯曲肘部，有
控制地放低身体，直到下巴与地面大约有一拳之隔（图20）。在动作的最低点暂停一下，然
后将自己推回到起始姿势。<br><br>
解析<br><br>
姿势正确的单臂俯卧撑是检验胸部与肘部力量的黄金标准，而且能够让人一见难忘。许
多健身者都声称自己能做单臂俯卧撑，但你千万不要被他们蒙骗。当你让他们动真格的时候，
你就会发现，他们所谓的单臂俯卧撑就是个笑话：双腿朝两边分开，上身丑陋地扭曲――这
是为了更容易做动作，然后他们会用摇摇摆摆、虚弱无力的胳膊猛地将自己推起，而且他们
只能完成少数几次反复。毫无疑问，真正能做单臂俯卧撑的人可谓是危险的稀有动物，你要
对自己有点儿信心，相信自己也能跻身其间。<br><br>
训练目标<br><br>
・初级标准：1 组，5 次（每侧）<br><br>
・中级标准：6：组，各10 次（每侧）<br><br>
・精英标准：1 组，100 次（每侧）<br><br>
稳扎稳打<br><br>
如果你已经攻克了杠杆俯卧撑，那么单臂俯卧撑对你而言就不是特别恐怖了。但是，如
果你还不能标准地完成5 次单臂俯卧撑，那么你还是回到第九式，确保自己可以标准地完成
20 次杠杆俯卧撑。如果你能做到这一点，但做单臂俯卧撑还是有问题，那么请你继续练习
杠杆俯卧撑，直到你可以完成30 次反复，然后再挑战单臂俯卧撑。<br><br>
